# Smart Health: Skin Diseases Classification & Symptom-based Disease Prediction LLM Chatbot

## Overview

**Smart Health** is an integrated AI-driven platform designed to assist users in early detection and understanding of skin diseases. The project leverages deep learning for skin disease image classification and a Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot for symptom-based disease prediction and Q&A. This dual approach empowers users with both image-based diagnostics and conversational health support.

## Features

- üñºÔ∏è **Skin Disease Image Classification**

  - Upload skin images to get instant predictions of possible skin conditions.
  - Uses state-of-the-art deep learning (e.g., MobileNetV2, EfficientNet) trained on 8+ skin disease classes.
  - Provides confidence scores for predictions.

- üí¨ **Symptom-based Disease Prediction Chatbot**

  - Enter symptoms in natural language to receive possible disease matches.
  - Powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned for medical Q&A.
  - Provides additional information: causes, prevention, risk factors, complications, and when to see a doctor.

- üè• **Conversational Health Guidance**

  - Offers explanations of diseases, symptoms, and next steps.
  - Extracts trusted information from sources like Mayo Clinic using web scraping.

- üìä **Analytics & Explainability**
  - Displays prediction confidence and highlights most probable conditions.
  - Visualizes key symptom-disease relationships.

## Model Performance

### Skin Disease Image Classifier Results

- **MobileNetV2**

  - **Best Validation Accuracy:** 92.70%
  - **Final Epochs:**
    - Epoch 10/10:
      - Training Accuracy: 97.69%
      - Validation Accuracy: 90.99%
      - Training Loss: 0.0764
      - Validation Loss: 0.2751

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-health-skin-diseases.git
cd smart-health-skin-diseases
```

### 2. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download/Train Models

- **Image Classifier:** Download the pre-trained model (`skin_disease_model_8_classes.h5` or `skin_disease_efficientnet8.pth`) and place it in the project root.
- **LLM Model:** Configure your API key or download the local LLM checkpoint as required.

### 4. Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
