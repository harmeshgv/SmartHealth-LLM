Atrial fibrillation,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350630,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/doctors-departments/ddc-20350632,"Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm. An irregular heart rhythm is called an arrhythmia.AFibcan lead to blood clots in the heart. The condition also increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications.
During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers — called the atria — beat chaotically and irregularly. They beat out of sync with the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. For many people,AFibmay have no symptoms. ButAFibmay cause a fast, pounding heartbeat, shortness of breath or light-headedness.
Episodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be persistent.AFibitself usually isn't life-threatening. But it's a serious medical condition that needs proper treatment to prevent stroke.
Treatment for atrial fibrillation may include medicines, therapy to shock the heart back to a regular rhythm and procedures to block faulty heart signals.
A person with atrial fibrillation also may have a related heart rhythm problem called atrial flutter. The treatments forAFiband atrial flutter are similar.","Symptoms ofAFibmay include:
Feelings of a fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeat, called palpitations.
Chest pain.
Dizziness.
Fatigue.
Lightheadedness.
Reduced ability to exercise.
Shortness of breath.
Weakness.
Some people with atrial fibrillation (AFib) don't notice any symptoms.
Atrial fibrillation may be:
Occasional, also called paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.AFibsymptoms come and go. The symptoms usually last for a few minutes to hours. Some people have symptoms for as long as a week. The episodes can happen repeatedly. Symptoms might go away on their own. Some people with occasionalAFibneed treatment.
Persistent.The irregular heartbeat is constant. The heart rhythm does not reset on its own. If symptoms occur, medical treatment is needed to correct the heart rhythm.
Long-standing persistent.This type ofAFibis constant and lasts longer than 12 months. Medicines or a procedure are needed to correct the irregular heartbeat.
Permanent.In this type of atrial fibrillation, the irregular heart rhythm can't be reset. Medicines are needed to control the heart rate and to prevent blood clots.","If you have symptoms of atrial fibrillation, make an appointment for a health checkup. You may be referred to a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist.
If you have chest pain, seek immediate medical help. Chest pain could mean that you're having a heart attack.","To understand the causes of atrial fibrillation (AFib), it may be helpful to know how the heart typically beats.
The heart has four chambers:
The two upper chambers are called the atria.
The two lower chambers are called the ventricles.
Inside the upper right heart chamber is a group of cells called the sinus node. The sinus node makes the signals that starts each heartbeat.
The signals move across the upper heart chambers. Next, the signals arrive at a group of cells called theAVnode, where they usually slow down. The signals then go to the lower heart chambers.
In a healthy heart, this signaling process usually goes smoothly. The resting heart rate is typically 60 to 100 beats a minute.
But in atrial fibrillation, the signals in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic. As a result, the upper chambers tremble or shake. TheAVnode is flooded with signals trying to get through to the lower heart chambers. This causes a fast and irregular heart rhythm.
In people withAFib, the heart rate may range from 100 to 175 beats a minute.","Things that can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation (AFib) include:
Age.The risk ofAFibincreases as you grow older.
Caffeine, nicotine or illegal drug use.Caffeine, nicotine and some illegal drugs — such as amphetamines and cocaine — can cause your heart to beat faster. Use of these substances may lead to the development of more-serious arrhythmias.
Drinking too much alcohol.Drinking too much alcohol can affect the electrical signals in the heart. This can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation.
Changes in the level of body minerals.Minerals in the blood called electrolytes — such as potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium — help the heart beat. If these substances are too low or too high, irregular heartbeats may occur.
Family history.An increased risk of atrial fibrillation occurs in some families.
Heart problems or heart surgery.Coronary artery disease, heart valve disease and heart problems present at birth increase the risk ofAFib. A history of heart attack or heart surgery also makes a person more likely to get the condition.
High blood pressure.Having high blood pressure increases the risk of getting coronary artery disease. Over time, high blood pressure may cause part of the heart to become stiff and thick. This can change how heartbeat signals travel through the heart.
Obesity.People who have obesity are at higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation.
Other long-term health conditions.You may be more likely to getAFibif you have diabetes, chronic kidney disease, lung disease or sleep apnea.
Some medicines and supplements.Some prescription medicines and certain cough and cold remedies bought without a prescription can cause irregular heartbeats.
Thyroid disease.Having an overactive thyroid gland can raise the risk of irregular heartbeats.","Blood clots are a dangerous complication of atrial fibrillation (AFib). Blood clots can lead to stroke.
The risk of stroke fromAFibincreases as you grow older. Other health conditions also may increase the risk of a stroke due toAFib. These conditions include:
High blood pressure.
Diabetes.
Heart failure.
Some types of heart valve disease.
Blood thinners are commonly prescribed to prevent blood clots and strokes in people with atrial fibrillation.","Healthy lifestyle choices can reduce the risk of heart disease and may prevent atrial fibrillation (AFib). Here are some basic heart-healthy tips:
Control high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.
Don't smoke or use tobacco.
Eat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat.
Exercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week unless your health care team says not to.
Get good sleep. Adults should aim for 7 to 9 hours daily.
Maintain a healthy weight.
Reduce and manage stress.","You may not know you have atrial fibrillation (AFib). The condition may be found when a health checkup is done for another reason.
To diagnoseAFib, the health care provider examines you and asks questions about your medical history and symptoms. Tests may be done to look for conditions that can cause irregular heartbeats, such as heart disease or thyroid disease.","The goals of atrial fibrillation treatment are to reset and control the heartbeat and prevent blood clots.
Treatment depends on:
How long you've hadAFib.
Your symptoms.
The cause of the irregular heartbeat.
Atrial fibrillation treatment may involve:
Medicine.
Therapy to reset the heart rhythm, called cardioversion.
Surgery or catheter procedures.
Together, you and your health care team discuss the best treatment option for you. It's important to follow your atrial fibrillation treatment plan. IfAFibisn't well controlled, it may lead to other complications, including stroke and heart failure.",,"If you have an irregular or pounding heartbeat, make an appointment for a health checkup. IfAFibis found early, treatment may be easier, and it may work better. You may be referred to a doctor trained in heart diseases. This type of provider is called a cardiologist.
Here's some information to help you prepare for your appointment.","Following a heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent or treat conditions that can lead to atrial fibrillation (AFib). The following changes are recommended to improve heart health:
Eat healthy foods.Choose plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Limit sugar, salt and saturated fats.
Exercise and stay active.Regular physical activity helps control diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure — all risk factors for heart disease. Try to get 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity most days of the week. Talk to your health care team about the amount and type of exercise that's best for you.
Don't smoke.Smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease. If you need help quitting, talk to your health care team.
Maintain a healthy weight.Being overweight increases the risk of heart disease. Talk with your care provider to set realistic goals for weight.
Control blood pressure.Get your blood pressure checked at least every two years if you're 18 and older. If you have risk factors for heart disease or are over age 40, you may need more-frequent checks. If you have high blood pressure, follow your treatment plan as directed.
Get your cholesterol checked.Ask your health care team how often you need a cholesterol test. Lifestyle changes and medicines may be recommended to control high cholesterol.
Limit alcohol.Binge drinking (having five drinks in two hours for men or four drinks for women) can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation. In some people, even lower amounts of alcohol can triggerAFib.
Practice good sleep habits.Poor sleep may increase the risk of heart disease and other chronic conditions. Adults should aim to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep daily.
It's also important to have regular health checkups. Tell your health care team if yourAFibsymptoms get worse."

You may sweat so much that it soaks through your clothes or drips off your hands. Heavy sweating can disrupt your day and cause social anxiety and embarrassment.
Hyperhidrosis treatment usually helps. It often begins with antiperspirants. If these don't help, you may need to try different medications and therapies. In severe cases, your health care provider may suggest surgery to remove the sweat glands or to disconnect the nerves related to producing too much sweat.
Sometimes an underlying condition may be found and treated.","The main symptom of hyperhidrosis is heavy sweating. This goes beyond the sweating from being in a hot environment, exercising, or feeling anxious or stressed. The type of hyperhidrosis that usually affects the hands, feet, underarms or face causes at least one episode a week when you're awake. And the sweating usually happens on both sides of the body.","Sometimes excessive sweating is a sign of a serious condition.
Seek immediate medical attentionif you have heavy sweating with dizziness, pain in the chest, throat, jaw, arms, shoulders or throat, or cold skin and a rapid pulse.
See your health care provider if:
Sweating disrupts your daily routine
Sweating causes emotional distress or social withdrawal
You suddenly begin to sweat more than usual
You experience night sweats for no apparent reason","Sweating is the body's mechanism to cool itself. The nervous system automatically triggers sweat glands when your body temperature rises. Sweating also occurs, especially on your palms, when you're nervous.
Primary hyperhidrosis is caused by faulty nerve signals that trigger eccrine sweat glands to become overactive. It usually affects the palms, soles, underarms and sometimes the face.
There is no medical cause for this type of hyperhidrosis. It can run in families.
Secondary hyperhidrosis is caused by an underlying medical condition or by taking certain medications, such as pain relievers, antidepressants, and some diabetes and hormonal medications. This type of hyperhidrosis may cause sweating all over the body. Conditions that might cause it include:
Diabetes
Menopause hot flashes
Thyroid problems
Some types of cancer
Nervous system disorders
Infections","Risk factors for hyperhidrosis include:
Having a blood relative, such as a parent, sibling or grandparent, who sweats heavily
Taking medicines or supplements that cause sweating
Having a medical condition that causes sweating","Complications of hyperhidrosis include:
Infections.People who sweat a lot are more prone to skin infections.

You may also need a physical exam or tests to further evaluate the cause of your symptoms.,"Treating hyperhidrosis may start with treating the condition causing it. If a cause isn't found, treatment focuses on controlling heavy sweating. If new self-care habits don't improve your symptoms, your health care provider may suggest one or more of the following treatments. Even if your sweating improves after treatment, it may recur.","Hyperhidrosis can be the cause of discomfort and embarrassment. You may have trouble working or enjoying recreational activities because of wet hands or feet or wet stains on clothing. You might feel anxious about your symptoms and become withdrawn or self-conscious. You may be frustrated or upset by other people's reactions.
Talk about your concerns with your health care provider, a counselor or a medical social worker. Or you may find it helpful to talk with other people who have hyperhidrosis.","You may start by seeing your primary care provider. You may then be referred to a specialist in diagnosing and treating conditions of the hair and skin (dermatologist). If your condition is not responding to treatment, you may be referred to a specialist in the nervous system (neurologist) or a surgeon.
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.","The following suggestions may help control sweating and body odor:
Use antiperspirant.Antiperspirants containing 6% to 20% aluminum chloride (Drysol, Xerac AC, others) can temporarily block sweat pores. This reduces the amount of sweat that reaches the skin. This type of product may help with minor hyperhidrosis. Apply it to dry skin before going to bed and wash it off when you wake.
Choose shoes and socks made of natural materials.Shoes made of natural materials, such as leather, allow your feet to breath, which helps prevent sweaty feet. Wear moisture-wicking athletic socks when you're active. In the store, you can tell which socks are moisture wicking by reading the packaging.
Keep your feet dry.Change socks or hose one or two times a day. Dry your feet each time. If you wear pantyhose, try the type with cotton soles. Use shoe insoles and foot powder to help absorb sweat. Wear sandals or go barefoot when you can. Or at least slip out of your shoes now and then.
Choose clothing to suit your activity.When you can, wear natural fabrics, such as cotton, wool and silk. These allow your skin to breathe. When you're very active, you might prefer fabrics designed to wick moisture away from your skin."

These glands secrete fluid that helps lubricate the vagina.

Sometimes the openings of these glands become obstructed, causing fluid to back up into the gland. The result is relatively painless swelling called a Bartholin's cyst. If the fluid within the cyst becomes infected, you may develop a collection of pus surrounded by inflamed tissue (abscess).

A Bartholin's cyst or abscess is common. Treatment of a Bartholin's cyst depends on the size of the cyst, how painful the cyst is and whether the cyst is infected.

Sometimes home treatment is all you need. In other cases, surgical drainage of the Bartholin's cyst is necessary. If an infection occurs, antibiotics may be helpful to treat the infected Bartholin's cyst.","If you have a small, noninfected Bartholin's cyst, you may not notice it. If the cyst grows, you might feel a lump or mass near your vaginal opening. Although a cyst is usually painless, it can be tender.

A full-blown infection of a Bartholin's cyst can occur in a matter of days. If the cyst becomes infected, you may experience:

A Bartholin's cyst or abscess typically occurs on only one side of the vaginal opening.","Call your doctor if you have a painful lump near the opening of your vagina that doesn't improve after two or three days of self-care — for instance, soaking the area in warm water (sitz bath). If the pain is severe, make an appointment with your doctor right away.

Also call your doctor promptly if you find a new lump near your vaginal opening and you're older than 40. Although rare, such a lump may be a sign of a more serious problem, such as cancer.","Experts believe that the cause of a Bartholin's cyst is a backup of fluid. Fluid may accumulate when the opening of the gland (duct) becomes obstructed, perhaps caused by infection or injury.

A Bartholin's cyst can become infected, forming an abscess. A number of bacteria may cause the infection, including Escherichia coli (E. coli) and bacteria that cause sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia.",,A Bartholin's cyst or abscess may recur and again require treatment.,"There's no way to prevent a Bartholin's cyst. However, safer sex practices — in particular, using condoms — and good hygiene habits may help to prevent infection of a cyst and the formation of an abscess.","To diagnose a Bartholin's cyst, your doctor may:

If cancer is a concern, your doctor may refer you to a gynecologist who specializes in cancers of the female reproductive system.","Often a Bartholin's cyst requires no treatment — especially if the cyst causes no signs or symptoms. When needed, treatment depends on the size of the cyst, your discomfort level and whether it's infected, which can result in an abscess.

Treatment options your doctor may recommend include:

Surgical drainage.You may need surgery to drain a cyst that's infected or very large. Drainage of a cyst can be done using local anesthesia or sedation.

For the procedure, your doctor makes a small incision in the cyst, allows it to drain, and then places a small rubber tube (catheter) in the incision. The catheter stays in place for up to six weeks to keep the incision open and allow complete drainage.

Rarely, for persistent cysts that aren't effectively treated by the above procedures, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the Bartholin's gland. Surgical removal is usually done in a hospital under general anesthesia. Surgical removal of the gland carries a greater risk of bleeding or complications after the procedure.",,Your first appointment will likely be with either your primary care provider or a doctor who specializes in conditions that affect women (gynecologist).,

For many people,AFibmay have no symptoms. ButAFibmay cause a fast, pounding heartbeat, shortness of breath or light-headedness.
Episodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be persistent.AFibitself usually isn't life-threatening. But it's a serious medical condition that needs proper treatment to prevent stroke.
Treatment for atrial fibrillation may include medicines, therapy to shock the heart back to a regular rhythm and procedures to block faulty heart signals.
A person with atrial fibrillation also may have a related heart rhythm problem called atrial flutter. The treatments forAFiband atrial flutter are similar.","Symptoms ofAFibmay include:
Feelings of a fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeat, called palpitations.
Chest pain.
Dizziness.
Fatigue.
Lightheadedness.
Reduced ability to exercise.
Shortness of breath.
Weakness.
Some people with atrial fibrillation (AFib) don't notice any symptoms.
Atrial fibrillation may be:
Occasional, also called paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.AFibsymptoms come and go. The symptoms usually last for a few minutes to hours. Some people have symptoms for as long as a week. The episodes can happen repeatedly. Symptoms might go away on their own. Some people with occasionalAFibneed treatment.
Persistent.The irregular heartbeat is constant. The heart rhythm does not reset on its own. If symptoms occur, medical treatment is needed to correct the heart rhythm.
Long-standing persistent.This type ofAFibis constant and lasts longer than 12 months. Medicines or a procedure are needed to correct the irregular heartbeat.
Permanent.In this type of atrial fibrillation, the irregular heart rhythm can't be reset. Medicines are needed to control the heart rate and to prevent blood clots.","If you have symptoms of atrial fibrillation, make an appointment for a health checkup. You may be referred to a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist.
If you have chest pain, seek immediate medical help. Chest pain could mean that you're having a heart attack.","To understand the causes of atrial fibrillation (AFib), it may be helpful to know how the heart typically beats.
The heart has four chambers:
The two upper chambers are called the atria.
The two lower chambers are called the ventricles.
Inside the upper right heart chamber is a group of cells called the sinus node. The sinus node makes the signals that starts each heartbeat.
The signals move across the upper heart chambers. Next, the signals arrive at a group of cells called theAVnode, where they usually slow down. The signals then go to the lower heart chambers.
In a healthy heart, this signaling process usually goes smoothly. The resting heart rate is typically 60 to 100 beats a minute.
But in atrial fibrillation, the signals in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic. As a result, the upper chambers tremble or shake. TheAVnode is flooded with signals trying to get through to the lower heart chambers. This causes a fast and irregular heart rhythm.
In people withAFib, the heart rate may range from 100 to 175 beats a minute.","Things that can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation (AFib) include:
Age.The risk ofAFibincreases as you grow older.
Caffeine, nicotine or illegal drug use.Caffeine, nicotine and some illegal drugs — such as amphetamines and cocaine — can cause your heart to beat faster. Use of these substances may lead to the development of more-serious arrhythmias.
Drinking too much alcohol.Drinking too much alcohol can affect the electrical signals in the heart. This can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation.
Changes in the level of body minerals.Minerals in the blood called electrolytes — such as potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium — help the heart beat. If these substances are too low or too high, irregular heartbeats may occur.
Family history.An increased risk of atrial fibrillation occurs in some families.
Heart problems or heart surgery.Coronary artery disease, heart valve disease and heart problems present at birth increase the risk ofAFib. A history of heart attack or heart surgery also makes a person more likely to get the condition.
High blood pressure.Having high blood pressure increases the risk of getting coronary artery disease. Over time, high blood pressure may cause part of the heart to become stiff and thick. This can change how heartbeat signals travel through the heart.
Obesity.People who have obesity are at higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation.
Other long-term health conditions.You may be more likely to getAFibif you have diabetes, chronic kidney disease, lung disease or sleep apnea.
Some medicines and supplements.Some prescription medicines and certain cough and cold remedies bought without a prescription can cause irregular heartbeats.
Thyroid disease.Having an overactive thyroid gland can raise the risk of irregular heartbeats.","Blood clots are a dangerous complication of atrial fibrillation (AFib). Blood clots can lead to stroke.
The risk of stroke fromAFibincreases as you grow older. Other health conditions also may increase the risk of a stroke due toAFib. These conditions include:
High blood pressure.
Diabetes.
Heart failure.
Some types of heart valve disease.
Blood thinners are commonly prescribed to prevent blood clots and strokes in people with atrial fibrillation.","Healthy lifestyle choices can reduce the risk of heart disease and may prevent atrial fibrillation (AFib). Here are some basic heart-healthy tips:
Control high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.
Don't smoke or use tobacco.
Eat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat.
Exercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week unless your health care team says not to.
Get good sleep. Adults should aim for 7 to 9 hours daily.
Maintain a healthy weight.
Reduce and manage stress.","You may not know you have atrial fibrillation (AFib). The condition may be found when a health checkup is done for another reason.
To diagnoseAFib, the health care provider examines you and asks questions about your medical history and symptoms. Tests may be done to look for conditions that can cause irregular heartbeats, such as heart disease or thyroid disease.","The goals of atrial fibrillation treatment are to reset and control the heartbeat and prevent blood clots.
Treatment depends on:
How long you've hadAFib.
Your symptoms.
The cause of the irregular heartbeat.
Atrial fibrillation treatment may involve:
Medicine.
Therapy to reset the heart rhythm, called cardioversion.
Surgery or catheter procedures.
Together, you and your health care team discuss the best treatment option for you. It's important to follow your atrial fibrillation treatment plan. IfAFibisn't well controlled, it may lead to other complications, including stroke and heart failure.",,"If you have an irregular or pounding heartbeat, make an appointment for a health checkup. IfAFibis found early, treatment may be easier, and it may work better. You may be referred to a doctor trained in heart diseases. This type of provider is called a cardiologist.
Here's some information to help you prepare for your appointment.","Following a heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent or treat conditions that can lead to atrial fibrillation (AFib). The following changes are recommended to improve heart health:
Eat healthy foods.Choose plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Limit sugar, salt and saturated fats.
Exercise and stay active.Regular physical activity helps control diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure — all risk factors for heart disease. Try to get 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity most days of the week. Talk to your health care team about the amount and type of exercise that's best for you.
Don't smoke.Smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease. If you need help quitting, talk to your health care team.
Maintain a healthy weight.Being overweight increases the risk of heart disease. Talk with your care provider to set realistic goals for weight.
Control blood pressure.Get your blood pressure checked at least every two years if you're 18 and older. If you have risk factors for heart disease or are over age 40, you may need more-frequent checks. If you have high blood pressure, follow your treatment plan as directed.
Get your cholesterol checked.Ask your health care team how often you need a cholesterol test. Lifestyle changes and medicines may be recommended to control high cholesterol.
Limit alcohol.Binge drinking (having five drinks in two hours for men or four drinks for women) can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation. In some people, even lower amounts of alcohol can triggerAFib.
Practice good sleep habits.Poor sleep may increase the risk of heart disease and other chronic conditions. Adults should aim to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep daily.
It's also important to have regular health checkups. Tell your health care team if yourAFibsymptoms get worse."

These glands secrete fluid that helps lubricate the vagina.

Sometimes the openings of these glands become obstructed, causing fluid to back up into the gland. The result is relatively painless swelling called a Bartholin's cyst. If the fluid within the cyst becomes infected, you may develop a collection of pus surrounded by inflamed tissue (abscess).

A Bartholin's cyst or abscess is common. Treatment of a Bartholin's cyst depends on the size of the cyst, how painful the cyst is and whether the cyst is infected.

Sometimes home treatment is all you need. In other cases, surgical drainage of the Bartholin's cyst is necessary.

If the pain is severe, make an appointment with your doctor right away.

Also call your doctor promptly if you find a new lump near your vaginal opening and you're older than 40. Although rare, such a lump may be a sign of a more serious problem, such as cancer.","Experts believe that the cause of a Bartholin's cyst is a backup of fluid. Fluid may accumulate when the opening of the gland (duct) becomes obstructed, perhaps caused by infection or injury.

Treatment options your doctor may recommend include:

Surgical drainage.You may need surgery to drain a cyst that's infected or very large. Drainage of a cyst can be done using local anesthesia or sedation.

For the procedure, your doctor makes a small incision in the cyst, allows it to drain, and then places a small rubber tube (catheter) in the incision. The catheter stays in place for up to six weeks to keep the incision open and allow complete drainage.

Rarely, for persistent cysts that aren't effectively treated by the above procedures, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the Bartholin's gland. Surgical removal is usually done in a hospital under general anesthesia. Surgical removal of the gland carries a greater risk of bleeding or complications after the procedure.",,Your first appointment will likely be with either your primary care provider or a doctor who specializes in conditions that affect women (gynecologist).,

A Bartholin's cyst or abscess typically occurs on only one side of the vaginal opening.","Call your doctor if you have a painful lump near the opening of your vagina that doesn't improve after two or three days of self-care — for instance, soaking the area in warm water (sitz bath). If the pain is severe, make an appointment with your doctor right away.

Also call your doctor promptly if you find a new lump near your vaginal opening and you're older than 40. Although rare, such a lump may be a sign of a more serious problem, such as cancer.","Experts believe that the cause of a Bartholin's cyst is a backup of fluid. Fluid may accumulate when the opening of the gland (duct) becomes obstructed, perhaps caused by infection or injury.

A Bartholin's cyst can become infected, forming an abscess. A number of bacteria may cause the infection, including Escherichia coli (E. coli) and bacteria that cause sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia.",,A Bartholin's cyst or abscess may recur and again require treatment.,"There's no way to prevent a Bartholin's cyst. However, safer sex practices — in particular, using condoms — and good hygiene habits may help to prevent infection of a cyst and the formation of an abscess.","To diagnose a Bartholin's cyst, your doctor may:

If cancer is a concern, your doctor may refer you to a gynecologist who specializes in cancers of the female reproductive system.","Often a Bartholin's cyst requires no treatment — especially if the cyst causes no signs or symptoms. When needed, treatment depends on the size of the cyst, your discomfort level and whether it's infected, which can result in an abscess.

Treatment options your doctor may recommend include:

Surgical drainage.You may need surgery to drain a cyst that's infected or very large. Drainage of a cyst can be done using local anesthesia or sedation.

For the procedure, your doctor makes a small incision in the cyst, allows it to drain, and then places a small rubber tube (catheter) in the incision. The catheter stays in place for up to six weeks to keep the incision open and allow complete drainage.

Rarely, for persistent cysts that aren't effectively treated by the above procedures, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the Bartholin's gland. Surgical removal is usually done in a hospital under general anesthesia. Surgical removal of the gland carries a greater risk of bleeding or complications after the procedure.",,Your first appointment will likely be with either your primary care provider or a doctor who specializes in conditions that affect women (gynecologist).,
Infant reflux,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/infant-acid-reflux/symptoms-causes/syc-20351408,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/infant-acid-reflux/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351412,,"Infant reflux is when a baby spits up liquid or food. It happens when stomach contents move back up from a baby's stomach into the esophagus. The esophagus is the muscular tube that connects the mouth to the stomach.
Reflux happens in infants many times a day. If your baby is content and growing well, reflux is not a cause for concern. Sometimes called gastroesophageal reflux, also called GER, the condition becomes less common as a baby gets older. It's unusual for infant reflux to continue after age 18 months.
Rarely, infant reflux leads to weight loss or growth that lags behind that of other children of the same age and sex. These symptoms may mean that your baby has a medical issue. This issue could be an allergy, a blockage in the digestive system or gastroesophageal reflux disease, also called GERD. GERD is a form of GER that causes serious health issues.","Most of the time, infant reflux isn't a cause for concern. It's not usual for stomach contents to have enough acid to irritate the throat or esophagus and cause symptoms.","See a healthcare professional if a baby:
Isn't gaining weight.
Consistently spits up forcefully, causing stomach contents to shoot out of the mouth. This is called projectile vomiting.
Spits up green or yellow fluid.
Spits up blood or stomach contents that look like coffee grounds.
Refuses to feed or eat.
Has blood in the stool.
Has difficulty breathing or a cough that won't go away.
Begins spitting up at age 6 months or older.
Is very irritable after eating.
Doesn't have much energy.
Some of these symptoms may mean serious but treatable conditions. These include GERD or a blockage in the digestive tract.","In infants, the ring of muscle between the esophagus and the stomach is not yet fully developed. This muscle is called the lower esophageal sphincter, also known as LES. When the LES is not fully developed, it allows stomach contents to flow back up into the esophagus. Over time, the LES typically matures. It opens when a baby swallows and remains tightly closed at other times, keeping stomach contents where they belong.
Some factors that contribute to infant reflux are common in babies and often can't be avoided. These include lying flat most of the time and being fed an almost completely liquid diet.
Sometimes, infant reflux can be caused by more-serious conditions, such as:
GERD.The reflux has enough acid to irritate and damage the lining of the esophagus.
Pyloric stenosis.A muscular valve allows food to leave the stomach and enter the small intestine as part of digestion. In pyloric stenosis, the valve thickens and becomes larger than it should. The thickened valve then traps food in the stomach and blocks it from entering the small intestine.
Food intolerance.A protein in cow's milk is the most common trigger.
Eosinophilic esophagitis.A certain type of white blood cell builds up and injures the lining of the esophagus. This white blood cell is called an eosinophil.
Sandifer syndrome.This causes tilting and rotation of the head that are not usual and movements that look like seizures. It's a rare complication of GERD.","Infant reflux is common. But some things make it more likely that a baby will have infant reflux. These include:
Premature birth.
Lung conditions, such as cystic fibrosis.
Conditions that affect the nervous system, such as cerebral palsy.
Previous surgery on the esophagus.","Infant reflux usually gets better on its own. It rarely causes problems for babies.
If your baby has a more serious condition such as GERD, your baby's growth may lag behind that of other children. Some research suggests that babies who have frequent episodes of spitting up might be more likely to develop GERD later in childhood.",,"To diagnose infant reflux, a healthcare professional typically starts with a physical exam and asks questions about a baby's symptoms. If a baby is growing as expected and seems content, then testing usually isn't needed. In some cases, however, a healthcare professional might recommend:
Ultrasound.This imaging test can detect pyloric stenosis.
Lab tests.Blood and urine tests can help find or rule out possible causes of poor weight gain and vomiting that happens often.
Esophageal pH monitoring.To measure the acidity in a baby's esophagus, the health professional places a thin tube through the baby's nose or mouth and into the esophagus. The tube is attached to a device that monitors acidity. A baby might need to stay in the hospital while being monitored.
X-rays.These images can detect problems in the digestive tract, such as a blockage. A baby may be given a contrast liquid with a bottle before the test. This liquid is usually barium.
Upper endoscopy.An upper endoscopy uses a tiny camera on the end of a flexible tube called an endoscope to visually examine the upper digestive system. Tissue samples may be taken for analysis. For infants and children, endoscopy usually is done under general anesthesia. General anesthesia causes a sleeplike state before surgery or other medical procedures.","For most babies, making some changes to feeding eases infant reflux until it gets better on its own.",,"You may start by seeing your baby's primary healthcare team. Or you may be referred to a specialist in children's digestive diseases, called a pediatric gastroenterologist.","To minimize reflux:
Feed your baby in an upright position.Then, hold your baby in a sitting position for 30 minutes after feeding. Gravity can help stomach contents stay where they belong. Be careful not to jostle or jiggle your baby while the food is settling.
Try smaller, more frequent feedings.Feed your baby a little bit less than usual if you're bottle-feeding, or cut back a little on nursing time.
Take time to burp your baby.Frequent burps during and after feeding can keep air from building up in your baby's stomach.
Put baby to sleep on the back.Most babies should be placed on their backs to sleep, even if they have reflux.
Keep in mind that infant reflux is usually little cause for concern. Just keep plenty of burp cloths handy as you wait for your baby's reflux to stop."
Hidradenitis suppurativa,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hidradenitis-suppurativa/symptoms-causes/syc-20352306,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hidradenitis-suppurativa/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352311,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hidradenitis-suppurativa/doctors-departments/ddc-20352315,"Hidradenitis suppurativa (hi-drad-uh-NIE-tis sup-yoo-ruh-TIE-vuh), also known as acne inversa, is a condition that causes small, painful lumps to form under the skin. The lumps usually develop in areas where your skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts. The lumps heal slowly, recur, and can lead to tunnels under the skin and scarring.
Hidradenitis suppurativa tends to start after puberty, usually before age 40. It can persist for many years and worsen over time. It can affect your daily life and emotional well-being. Combined medical and surgical therapy can help manage the disease and prevent complications.
Women are three times more likely to develop hidradenitis suppurativa, though this ratio can differ by location around the world. Also, Black people are more likely to develop this disease than people of other races. This could be attributed to genetic factors.","Hidradenitis suppurativa can affect one or several areas of the body. Signs and symptoms of the condition include:
Blackheads.Blackheads appear in small, pitted areas of skin, often appearing in pairs.
Painful pea-sized lumps.The condition usually starts with a single, painful lump under the skin that persists for weeks or months. More bumps may form later, usually in areas where you have more sweat and oil glands or where the skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts.
Leaking bumps or sores.Some bumps or sores get bigger, break open and drain pus with an odor.
Tunnels.Over time, tunnels might form under the skin, connecting the lumps. These wounds heal slowly, if at all, and drain blood and pus.
Some people with this condition experience only mild symptoms. The course of the disease is highly variable. Excess weight and being a smoker are associated with worse symptoms, but people who are thin and don't smoke can experience severe disease.","Early diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa is key to effective treatment. See your dermatologist if your condition:
Is painful.
Makes it difficult to move.
Doesn't improve in a few weeks.
Returns within weeks of treatment.
Appears in several locations.
Flares often.
Your dermatologist can create a treatment plan for you.
Hidradenitis suppurativa is not just a boil, and many people with this condition also have related conditions. People with hidradenitis suppurativa benefit from a health care team with medical and surgical dermatologists at the core. Other specialists are involved as needed.","Hidradenitis suppurativa develops when hair follicles become blocked, but why this blockage occurs isn't known. Experts think it could be connected to hormones, genetic predisposition, cigarette smoking or excess weight.
An infection or being unclean does not cause hidradenitis suppurativa, and it can't be spread to other people.","Factors that increase your chance of developing hidradenitis suppurativa include:
Age.The risk of hidradenitis suppurativa is higher for people in their teens and 20s.
Sex.Females are more likely to develop hidradenitis suppurativa than males.
Race.Ethnicity or race might affect risk level. The condition occurs most in Black people, possibly due to genetic factors.
Family history.A tendency to develop hidradenitis suppurativa can be inherited.
Certain conditions.Hidradenitis suppurativa is more common and severe in people who are overweight. It also has an association with severe acne, arthritis, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.
Smoking.Smoking tobacco has been linked to hidradenitis suppurativa.","Persistent and severe hidradenitis suppurativa can cause complications, including:
Infection.Secondary infection is possible in the affected area, but the presence of pus is common in hidradenitis suppurativa and doesn't necessarily mean infection.
Scars and skin changes.The wounds may heal but leave ropelike scars or pitted skin.
Restricted movement.Sores and scar tissue can cause limited or painful movement, especially when the disease affects the armpits or thighs.
Skin cancer.Squamous cell carcinoma has been reported with long-term hidradenitis suppurativa, particularly in people whose condition involves the perianal area. This area consists of the tissues around the anus.
Swelling in the arms, legs or genitals.The most common sites for hidradenitis suppurativa also contain many lymph nodes. Scar tissue can interfere with the lymph drainage system, which can cause the arms, legs or genitals to swell.
Psychological effects and social isolation.The location, drainage and odor of the sores can cause embarrassment and reluctance to go out in public, leading to anxiety or depression.
Lifelong pain.This pain is much worse than diseases such as psoriasis.",,"Hidradenitis suppurativa can be mistaken for pimples or acne. For many people, it takes years to receive a correct diagnosis.
Your health care provider will base a diagnosis on your signs and symptoms, skin appearance, and medical history. You might be referred to a health care provider who specializes in skin conditions, also known as a dermatologist. Hidradenitis suppurativa can be difficult to diagnose and requires specialized care.
No laboratory test is available to diagnose hidradenitis suppurativa. But if pus or drainage is present, your health care provider might take a sample for lab testing.","Treatment with medicines, surgery or both can help control symptoms and prevent complications of hidradenitis suppurativa. Talk with your health care provider about the risks and benefits of the treatment options and how to develop an approach that's right for you.
Expect to have regular follow-up visits with your dermatologist. Some people might need the comprehensive care provided by a health care team with members from multiple medical specialties.","Hidradenitis suppurativa can be a challenge to your emotional health and well-being. Painful sores might affect your sleep, ability to move or sex life. Or the sores might drain pus with an odor, which might make you feel anxious, embarrassed, angry, self-conscious or depressed. The ongoing, persistent nature of the disease and its treatment challenges add to the burden.
Try to find support among your family and friends. The concern and understanding of other people with hidradenitis suppurativa also might be comforting. Ask for help with your mental health and coping strategies. Your health care provider can refer you to a mental health professional or provide the contact information for a support group.","You'll likely first see your primary care provider. You might then be referred to a health care provider who specializes in diagnosing and treating skin diseases, also known as a dermatologist. Depending on the severity of your condition, your care also might involve specialists in colorectal surgery, plastic surgery or gastroenterology.
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.","Mild hidradenitis suppurativa can sometimes be effectively controlled with self-care measures. Self-care is also an important complement to medical treatment.
These suggestions might relieve discomfort, speed healing or prevent flare-ups:
Follow a daily skin care routine.Gently wash your body with a cleanser that is not soap. It can sometimes be helpful to use an antiseptic wash such as chlorhexidine 4% or benzoyl peroxide wash when showering. Try it once a week at first and then increase use to once daily if your skin tolerates it well. Pat dry. When washing, avoid using washcloths, loofahs or other such items on affected areas, as they can irritate skin. Don't squeeze pimples and sores. And avoid shaving or using hair-removing, or depilatory, creams.
Manage your pain.Gently applying a warm compress can reduce swelling and ease pain. Ask your health care provider about an appropriate pain reliever and how to care for your wounds at home.
Try to keep or achieve a healthy weight and stay active.Not being at a healthy weight can worsen the symptoms of hidradenitis suppurativa. Talk with your health care team to develop a plan. Try to find activities that don't irritate your skin.
Consider altering your diet.Diets that include dairy, red meat and foods with a high glycemic index might worsen hidradenitis suppurativa symptoms. If your diet includes these foods, talk with a dietitian about the benefits of eliminating them.
Quit smoking.If you smoke, try to quit. Stopping smoking can ease the symptoms of hidradenitis suppurativa."
HIV/AIDS,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiv-aids/symptoms-causes/syc-20373524,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiv-aids/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20373531,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiv-aids/doctors-departments/ddc-20373532,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is an ongoing, also called chronic, condition. It's caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, also called HIV.HIVdamages the immune system so that the body is less able to fight infection and disease. IfHIVisn't treated, it can take years before it weakens the immune system enough to becomeAIDS. Thanks to treatment, most people in the U.S. don't getAIDS.
HIVis spread through contact with genitals, such as during sex without a condom. This type of infection is called a sexually transmitted infection, also called an STI.HIValso is spread through contact with blood, such as when people share needles or syringes. It is also possible for a person with untreatedHIVto spread the virus to a child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.
There's no cure forHIV/AIDS. But medicines can control the infection and keep the disease from getting worse. Antiviral treatments forHIVhave reducedAIDSdeaths around the world. There's an ongoing effort to make ways to prevent and treatHIV/AIDSmore available in resource-poor countries.",The symptoms ofHIVandAIDSvary depending on the person and the phase of infection.,"If you think you may have been infected withHIVor are at risk of contracting the virus, see a healthcare professional as soon as you can.","HIVis caused by a virus. It can spread through sexual contact, shooting of illicit drugs or use of shared needles, and contact with infected blood. It also can spread from parent to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.
HIVdestroys white blood cells called CD4 T cells. These cells play a large role in helping the body fight disease. The fewer CD4 T cells you have, the weaker your immune system becomes.","Anyone of any age, race, sex or sexual orientation can haveHIV/AIDS. However, you're at greatest risk ofHIV/AIDSif you:
Have unprotected sex.Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex. Anal sex is riskier than is vaginal sex. Your risk ofHIVincreases if you have more than one sexual partner.
Have anSTI.ManySTIscause open sores on the genitals. These sores allowHIVto enter the body.
Inject illicit drugs.If you share needles and syringes, you can be exposed to infected blood.",HIVinfection weakens your immune system. The infection makes you much more likely to get many infections and certain types of cancers.,"There's no vaccine to preventHIVinfection and no cure forHIV/AIDS. But you can protect yourself and others from infection.
To help prevent the spread ofHIV:
Consider preexposure prophylaxis, also called PrEP.There are twoPrEPmedicines taken by mouth, also called oral, and onePrEPmedicine given in the form of a shot, called injectable. The oral medicines are emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) and emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Descovy). The injectable medicine is called cabotegravir (Apretude).PrEPcan reduce the risk of sexually transmittedHIVinfection in people at very high risk.PrEPcan reduce the risk of gettingHIVfrom sex by about 99% and from injecting drugs by at least 74%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Descovy hasn't been studied in people who have sex by having a penis put into their vaginas, called receptive vaginal sex.Cabotegravir (Apretude) is the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approvedPrEPthat can be given as a shot to reduce the risk of sexually transmittedHIVinfection in people at very high risk. A healthcare professional gives the shot. After two once-monthly shots, Apretude is given every two months. The shot is an option in place of a dailyPrEPpill.Your healthcare professional prescribes these medicines to preventHIVonly to people who don't already haveHIVinfection. You need anHIVtest before you start taking anyPrEP. You need to take the test every three months for the pills or before each shot for as long as you takePrEP.You need to take the pills every day or closely follow the shot schedule. You still need to practice safe sex to protect against otherSTIs. If you have hepatitis B, you should see an infectious disease or liver specialist before beginningPrEPtherapy.
Use treatment as prevention, also called TasP.If you haveHIV, takingHIVmedicines can keep your partner from getting infected with the virus. If your blood tests show no virus, that means your viral load can't be detected. Then you won't transmit the virus to anyone else through sex.If you useTasP, you must take your medicines exactly as prescribed and get regular checkups.
Use post-exposure prophylaxis, also called PEP, if you've been exposed toHIV.If you think you've been exposed through sex, through needles or in the workplace, contact your healthcare professional or go to an emergency room. TakingPEPas soon as you can within the first 72 hours can greatly reduce your risk of gettingHIV. You need to take the medicine for 28 days.
Use a new condom every time you have anal or vaginal sex.Both male and female condoms are available. If you use a lubricant, make sure it's water based. Oil-based lubricants can weaken condoms and cause them to break.During oral sex, use a cut-open condom or a piece of medical-grade latex called a dental dam without a lubricant.
Tell your sexual partners you haveHIV.It's important to tell all your current and past sexual partners that you'reHIVpositive. They need to be tested.
Use clean needles.If you use needles to inject illicit drugs, make sure the needles are sterile. Don't share them. Use needle-exchange programs in your community. Seek help for your drug use.
If you're pregnant, get medical care right away.You can passHIVto your baby. But if you get treatment during pregnancy, you can lessen your baby's risk greatly.
Consider male circumcision.Studies show that removing the foreskin from the penis, called circumcision, can help reduce the risk of gettingHIVinfection.","HIVcan be diagnosed through blood or saliva testing. Tests include:
Antigen-antibody tests.These tests most often use blood from a vein. Antigens are substances on theHIVvirus itself. They most often show up in the blood within a few weeks after being exposed toHIV.The immune system makes antibodies when it's exposed toHIV. It can take weeks to months for antibodies to show up in blood. You may not show a positive result on an antigen-antibody test until 2 to 6 weeks after exposure toHIV.
Antibody tests.These tests look for antibodies toHIVin blood or saliva. Most rapidHIVtests are antibody tests. This includes self-tests done at home. You may not show a positive result on an antibody test until 3 to 12 weeks after you've been exposed toHIV.
Nucleic acid tests (NATs).These tests look for the virus in your blood, called viral load. They use blood from a vein.If you might have been exposed toHIVwithin the past few weeks, your healthcare professional may suggestNAT.NATis the first test to become positive after exposure toHIV.
Talk with your healthcare professional about whichHIVtest is right for you. If any of these tests are negative, you may need a follow-up test weeks to months later to confirm the results.","There's no cure forHIV/AIDS. Once you have the infection, your body can't get rid of it. But there are medicines that can controlHIVand prevent complications.
Everyone diagnosed withHIVshould take antiretroviral therapy medicines, also called ART. This is true no matter what stage the disease is in or what the complications are.
ARTis usually a mix of two or more medicines from several classes. This approach has the best chance of lowering the amount ofHIVin the blood. There are manyARToptions that mix more than oneHIVmedicine into a single pill, taken once daily.
Each class of medicines blocks the virus in different ways. Treatment involves mixing medicines from different classes to:
Account for medicine resistance, called viral genotype.
Keep from creating new medicine-resistant strains ofHIV.
Suppress the virus in the blood as much as possible.
Two medicines from one class, plus a third medicine from another class, are most often used.
The classes of anti-HIVmedicines include the following:
Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)turn off a protein needed byHIVto make copies of itself.Examples include efavirenz, rilpivirine (Edurant) and doravirine (Pifeltro).
Nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)are faulty versions of the building blocks thatHIVneeds to make copies of itself.Examples include abacavir (Ziagen), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread), emtricitabine (Emtriva), lamivudine (Epivir) and zidovudine (Retrovir). Retrovir is no longer suggested for routine use in the U.S. because of high rates of toxic effects.Mixes of medicines also are available, such as emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) and emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Descovy).
Protease inhibitors (PIs)makeHIVprotease inactive.HIVprotease is another protein thatHIVneeds to make copies of itself.Examples include atazanavir (Reyataz), darunavir (Prezista) and lopinavir-ritonavir (Kaletra).
Integrase inhibitorsstop the action of a protein called integrase.HIVuses integrase to put its genetic material into CD4 T cells.Examples include bictegravir sodium-emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Biktarvy), raltegravir (Isentress), dolutegravir (Tivicay) and cabotegravir (Vocabria).
Entry or fusion inhibitorsblockHIV'sentry into CD4 T cells.Examples include enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) and maraviroc (Selzentry). Newer medicines include ibalizumab-uiyk (Trogarzo) and fostemsavir (Rukobia).","Getting a diagnosis of any life-threatening illness can cause distress. The emotional, social and financial effects ofHIV/AIDScan make coping with this illness very hard for you and for those close to you.
But there are many services and resources for people withHIV. MostHIV/AIDSclinics have social workers, counselors or nurses who can help you or put you in touch with people who can help you.
They may be able to:
Arrange transportation to and from medical appointments.
Help with housing and child care.
Assist with employment and legal issues.
Provide support during financial crises.
It's important to have a support system. Many people withHIV/AIDSfind that talking with someone who knows about their disease gives them comfort.","If you think you might have anHIVinfection, you're likely to start by seeing your family healthcare professional. You may be sent to an infectious disease specialist who focuses on treatingHIV/AIDS.","Besides getting medical treatment, you need to take an active role in your own care. The following may help you stay healthy longer:
Eat healthy foods.Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein help keep you strong, give you more energy and support your immune system. Eat enough calories to keep your weight stable.
Avoid raw meat, eggs and more.Foodborne illnesses can be severe in people who are infected withHIV. Cook meat until it's well done. Don't use dairy products that aren't treated for bacteria, called pasteurized. Don't eat raw eggs and raw seafood such as oysters, sushi or sashimi. Don't drink water you don't know is safe.
Get the right vaccinations.These may prevent common infections such as pneumonia, influenza,COVID-19and mpox. Your healthcare professional also may suggest other vaccinations, including those forHPV, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Vaccines that don't have live viruses mostly are safe. But most vaccines with live viruses are not safe because of your weakened immune system.
Take care with pets.Some animals may carry parasites that can cause infections in people who areHIVpositive. Cat stool can cause toxoplasmosis, reptiles can carry salmonella, and birds can carry cryptococcus or histoplasmosis. Wash hands thoroughly after handling pets or emptying litter boxes."
Acute myelogenous leukemia,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-myelogenous-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369109,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-myelogenous-leukemia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369115,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-myelogenous-leukemia/doctors-departments/ddc-20369117,"Acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML, is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft matter inside bones where blood cells are made.
The word ""acute"" in acute myelogenous leukemia means the disease tends to get worse quickly. It's called myelogenous (my-uh-LOHJ-uh-nus) leukemia because it affects cells called the myeloid cells. These typically develop into mature blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.
AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. The other type is acute lymphoblastic leukemia, also called ALL. Although AML can be diagnosed at any age, it is less common before age 45. AML also is called acute myeloid leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.
Unlike other cancers, there are no numbered stages of acute myelogenous leukemia.","Symptoms of acute myelogenous leukemia may include:
Fever.
Pain. Common places for pain include the bones, back and stomach.
Feeling very tired.
Paleness or change in skin color.
Frequent infections.
Easy bruising.
Bleeding with no clear cause, such as in the nose or gums.
Shortness of breath.","Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you have ongoing symptoms that worry you. Acute myelogenous leukemia symptoms are like those of many more-common conditions, such as infections. The healthcare professional may check for those causes first.","It's often not clear what causes acute myelogenous leukemia.
Healthcare professionals know that it starts when something causes changes to the DNA inside cells in the bone marrow. The bone marrow is the spongy material inside bones. It's where blood cells are made.
The changes that lead to acute myelogenous leukemia are thought to happen in cells called myeloid cells. Myeloid cells are bone marrow cells that can turn into the blood cells that circulate through the body. Healthy myeloid cells can become:
Red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body.
Platelets, which help stop bleeding.
White blood cells, which help fight infections.
Every cell in the body contains DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. But when the DNA changes happen in the myeloid cells, the changes give different instructions. The myeloid cells start to make a lot of extra cells, and they don't stop.
The DNA changes cause the myeloid cells to make a lot of immature white blood cells, called myeloblasts. The myeloblasts don't work right. They can build up in the bone marrow. They can crowd out healthy blood cells. Without enough healthy blood cells, there might be low oxygen levels in the blood, easy bruising and bleeding, and frequent infections.","Factors that may increase the risk of acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML, include:
Older age.Acute myelogenous leukemia is most common in adults age 65 and older.
Prior cancer treatment.People who've had certain types of chemotherapy and radiation therapy may have a greater risk of AML.
Radiation exposure.People exposed to very high levels of radiation, such as a nuclear reactor accident, have an increased risk of developing AML.
Dangerous chemical exposure.Certain chemicals, such as benzene, are linked to a greater risk of AML.
Smoking cigarettes.AML is linked to cigarette smoke, which contains benzene and other known cancer-causing chemicals.
Other blood disorders.People who've had another blood disorder, such as myelodysplasia, myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera or thrombocythemia, are at greater risk of AML.
Genetic disorders.Certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, are associated with an increased risk of AML.
Family history.People with a close blood relative, such as a sibling, parent or grandparent with a blood or bone marrow disorder are at higher risk for AML.
Many people with AML have no known risk factors, and many people who have risk factors never develop the cancer.",,,"Acute myeloid leukemia diagnosis often begins with an exam that checks for bruising, bleeding in the mouth or gums, infection, and swollen lymph nodes. Other tests include blood and lab tests, bone marrow biopsy, lumbar puncture, and imaging.
Tests and exams to diagnose acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML, include:","Many types of treatment exist for acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML. Treatment depends on several factors, including the subtype of the disease, your age, your overall health, your prognosis and your preferences.
Treatment usually has two phases:
Remission induction therapy.This first phase aims to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow. But it doesn't usually destroy all the leukemia cells. You will need further treatment to keep the disease from coming back.
Consolidation therapy.This phase also is called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy. It aims to kill the remaining leukemia cells. Consolidation therapy is crucial to helping lower the risk of relapse.
Treatments include:
Chemotherapy.Chemotherapy treats cancer with strong medicines. Most chemotherapy medicines are given through a vein. Some come in pill form. Chemotherapy is the main type of remission induction therapy. It also may be used for consolidation therapy.
People with AML usually stay in the hospital during chemotherapy treatments because the medicines kill many healthy blood cells while destroying leukemia cells. If the first chemotherapy cycle doesn't cause remission, it can be repeated.
Side effects of chemotherapy depend on the medicines you're given. Common side effects are nausea and hair loss. Serious, long-term complications may include heart disease, lung damage, fertility problems and other cancers.
Targeted therapy.Targeted therapy for cancer is a treatment that uses medicines that attack specific chemicals in the cancer cells. By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy may be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy during induction therapy.
Bone marrow transplant.A bone marrow transplant, also called a bone marrow stem cell transplant, involves putting healthy bone marrow stem cells into the body. These cells replace cells hurt by chemotherapy and other treatments. A bone marrow stem cell transplant may be used for both remission induction and consolidation therapy.
Before a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor. This is called an allogeneic transplant.
There is an increased risk of infection after a transplant.
Clinical trials.Some people with leukemia choose to enroll in clinical trials to try experimental treatments or new combinations of known therapies.","Acute myelogenous leukemia is a fast-growing cancer that requires quick decision-making. The following tips and resources may help you cope:
Learn enough about acute myelogenous leukemia to make decisions about your care.The term leukemia can be confusing because it refers to a group of cancers that aren't all that alike except that they all affect the bone marrow and blood.You can waste a lot of time researching information that doesn't apply to your kind of leukemia. To avoid that, ask your doctor to write down as many details as possible about your specific disease. Then narrow your search to that disease.Look for information at your local library and on the internet. You can start your information search with the National Cancer Institute and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.
Lean on family, friends and others.Having a support system can help you cope. Get support from people close to you, a formal support group or others coping with cancer.
Take care of yourself.It's easy to get caught up in tests, treatments and procedures. But it's important to take care of yourself, not just the cancer. Try to make time for cooking, watching sports or other favorite activities. Get plenty of sleep, see friends, write in a journal and spend time outside if you can.
Stay active.Receiving a diagnosis of cancer doesn't mean you have to stop doing the things you enjoy. If you feel well enough to do something, do it. Check with your healthcare professional about starting any exercise program.","Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you have symptoms that worry you. You may be referred to a doctor who specializes in blood cell diseases. This type of doctor is called a hematologist.
Appointments can be brief, and there's a lot of information to discuss. It's a good idea to be prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready:",
Guillain-Barre syndrome,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362793,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20363006,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/doctors-departments/ddc-20363037,"Guillain-Barre (gee-YAH-buh-RAY) syndrome is a condition in which the body's immune system attacks the nerves. It can cause weakness, numbness or paralysis.
Weakness and tingling in the hands and feet are usually the first symptoms. These sensations can quickly spread and may lead to paralysis. In its most serious form, Guillain-Barre syndrome is a medical emergency. Most people with the condition need treatment in a hospital.
Guillain-Barre syndrome is rare, and the exact cause is not known. But two-thirds of people have symptoms of an infection in the six weeks before Guillain-Barre symptoms begin. Infections can include a respiratory or a gastrointestinal infection, includingCOVID-19. Guillain-Barre also can be caused by the Zika virus.
There's no known cure for Guillain-Barre syndrome. Several treatment options can ease symptoms and help speed recovery. Most people recover completely from Guillain-Barre syndrome, but some serious illnesses can be fatal. While recovery may take up to several years, most people are able to walk again six months after symptoms first began. Some people may have lasting effects, such as weakness, numbness or fatigue.","Guillain-Barre syndrome often begins with tingling and weakness starting in the feet and legs and spreading to the upper body and arms. Some people notice the first symptoms in the arms or face. As Guillain-Barre syndrome progresses, muscle weakness can turn into paralysis.
Symptoms of Guillain-Barre syndrome may include:
A pins and needles feeling in the fingers, toes, ankles or wrists.
Weakness in the legs that spreads to the upper body.
Unsteady walk or not being able to walk or climb stairs.
Trouble with facial movements, including speaking, chewing or swallowing.
Double vision or inability to move the eyes.
Severe pain that may feel achy, shooting or cramplike and may be worse at night.
Trouble with bladder control or bowel function.
Rapid heart rate.
Low or high blood pressure.
Trouble breathing.
People with Guillain-Barre syndrome usually experience their most significant weakness within two weeks after symptoms begin.","Call your healthcare professional if you have mild tingling in your toes or fingers that doesn't seem to be spreading or getting worse. Seek emergency medical help if you have any of these serious symptoms:
Tingling that started in your feet or toes and is now moving up your body.
Tingling or weakness that's spreading quickly.
Trouble catching your breath or shortness of breath when lying flat.
Choking on saliva.
Guillain-Barre syndrome is a serious condition that requires immediate hospitalization because it can worsen quickly. The sooner treatment is started, the better the chance of a complete recovery.","The exact cause of Guillain-Barre syndrome isn't known. It usually appears days or weeks after a respiratory or digestive tract infection. Rarely, recent surgery or vaccination can trigger Guillain-Barre syndrome.
In Guillain-Barre syndrome, your immune system — which usually attacks only invading organisms — begins attacking the nerves. InAIDP, the nerves' protective covering, known as the myelin sheath, is damaged. The damage prevents nerves from transmitting signals to your brain, causing weakness, numbness or paralysis.
Guillain-Barre syndrome may be triggered by:
Most commonly, an infection with campylobacter, a type of bacteria often found in undercooked poultry.
Influenza virus.
Cytomegalovirus.
Epstein-Barr virus.
Zika virus.
Hepatitis A, B, C and E.
HIV, the virus that causesAIDS.
Mycoplasma pneumonia.
Surgery.
Trauma.
Hodgkin lymphoma.
Rarely, influenza vaccinations or childhood vaccinations.
COVID-19virus.","Guillain-Barre syndrome can affect all age groups, but the risk increases as you age. It's also slightly more common in males than females.","Guillain-Barre syndrome affects your nerves. Because nerves control your movements and body functions, people with Guillain-Barre syndrome may experience:
Trouble breathing.Weakness or paralysis can spread to the muscles that control your breathing. This can potentially be fatal. Up to 22% of people with Guillain-Barre syndrome need temporary help from a machine to breathe within the first week when they're hospitalized for treatment.
Residual numbness or other sensations.Most people with Guillain-Barre syndrome recover completely or have only minor, residual weakness, numbness or tingling.
Heart and blood pressure problems.Blood pressure fluctuations and irregular heart rhythms are common side effects of Guillain-Barre syndrome.
Pain.One-third of people with Guillain-Barre syndrome experience nerve pain, which may be eased with medicine.
Trouble with bowel and bladder function.Sluggish bowel function and urine retention may result from Guillain-Barre syndrome.
Blood clots.People who are not mobile due to Guillain-Barre syndrome are at risk of developing blood clots. Until you're able to walk independently, you may need to take blood thinners and wear support stockings to improve blood flow.
Pressure sores.You may be at risk of developing bedsores, also known as pressure sores, if you're not able to move. Changing your position often may help avoid this problem.
Relapse.A small percentage of people with Guillain-Barre syndrome have a relapse. A relapse can cause muscle weakness even years after symptoms ended.
When early symptoms are worse, the risk of serious long-term complications goes up. Rarely, death may occur from complications such as respiratory distress syndrome and heart attacks.",,"Guillain-Barre syndrome can be hard to diagnose in its earliest stages. Its symptoms are similar to those of other conditions and may vary from person to person.
Your healthcare professional starts with a medical history and thorough physical exam.
Your healthcare professional may then recommend:
Spinal tap, also known as a lumbar puncture.A small amount of fluid is withdrawn from the spinal canal in your lower back. The fluid is tested for a type of change that commonly occurs in people who have Guillain-Barre syndrome.
Electromyography.Thin-needle electrodes are inserted into the muscles to measure nerve activity.
Nerve conduction studies.Electrodes are taped to the skin above your nerves. A small shock is passed through the nerve to measure the speed of nerve signals.","There's no cure for Guillain-Barre syndrome. But two types of treatments can speed recovery and reduce symptoms:
Plasma exchange, also known as plasmapheresis.Plasma is the liquid portion of part of your blood. In a plasma exchange, plasma is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then put back into your body, which makes more plasma to replace what was removed. Plasmapheresis may work by ridding plasma of certain antibodies that contribute to the immune system's attack on the peripheral nerves.
Immunoglobulin therapy.Immunoglobulin containing healthy antibodies from blood donors is given through a vein. High doses of immunoglobulin can block the damaging antibodies that may contribute to Guillain-Barre syndrome.
These treatments are equally effective. Mixing them or using one after the other is no more effective than using either method alone.
You are also likely to be given medicine to:
Relieve pain, which can be severe.
Prevent blood clots, which can develop if you're not mobile.
People with Guillain-Barre syndrome need physical help and therapy before and during recovery. Your care may include:
Movement of your arms and legs by caregivers before recovery, to help keep your muscles flexible and strong.
Physical therapy during recovery to help you cope with fatigue and regain strength and proper movement.
Training with adaptive devices, such as a wheelchair or braces, to give you mobility and self-care skills.","A diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome can be emotionally hard. Although most people eventually recover fully, the condition is generally painful and requires hospitalization and months of rehabilitation. People with Guillain-Barre syndrome must adjust to limited mobility and fatigue.
To manage the stress of recovery from Guillain-Barre syndrome, consider these suggestions:
Maintain a strong support system of friends and family.
Contact a support group, for yourself or for family members.
Discuss your feelings and concerns with a counselor.","You may be referred to a doctor who specializes in disorders of the brain and nervous system, known as a neurologist.",
Acute kidney injury,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20369048,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-failure/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369053,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-failure/doctors-departments/ddc-20369054,"Acute kidney injury happens when the kidneys suddenly can't filter waste products from the blood. When the kidneys can't filter wastes, harmful levels of wastes may build up. The blood's chemical makeup may get out of balance.
Acute kidney injury used to be called acute kidney failure. Acute kidney injury is most common in people who are in the hospital, mostly in people who need intensive care.
Acute kidney injury ranges from mild to severe. If severe, ongoing and not treated, it can be fatal. But it also can be reversed. People in otherwise good health may get back typical or nearly typical use of their kidneys.","Symptoms of acute kidney injury may include:
Less urine output.
Fluid buildup, which can cause shortness of breath and swelling in the legs, ankles or feet.
Tiredness.
Confusion or fogginess.
Nausea.
Pain in the belly or in the side below the rib cage.
Weakness.
Irregular heartbeat.
Itching.
Loss of appetite.
Chest pain or pressure.
Seizures or coma in severe cases.
Sometimes acute kidney injury causes no symptoms. Then it may be found through lab tests done for something else.",See your healthcare professional right away or seek emergency care if you have symptoms of acute kidney injury.,"Acute kidney injury can happen when:
You have a condition that slows blood flow to your kidneys.
You have damage to your kidneys.
Your kidneys' urine drainage tubes, called ureters, get blocked.","Acute kidney injury almost always is linked to another medical condition or event. Conditions that can increase your risk of acute kidney injury include:
Ongoing kidney disease, also called chronic kidney disease.
Older age, but it does happen to children.
Being in the hospital, most often for a serious condition that needs intensive care.
Blockages in the blood vessels in your arms or legs, called peripheral artery disease.
Diabetes, especially if it's not controlled.
High blood pressure.
Heart failure.
Liver diseases.
Certain cancers and their treatments.","Complications of acute kidney injury may include:
Fluid buildup.A buildup of fluid in your lungs can cause shortness of breath.
Chest pain.The lining that covers your heart, called the pericardium, can get inflamed. This can cause chest pain.
Muscle weakness.This can result from the body's fluids and minerals in the blood called electrolytes being out of balance.
Permanent kidney damage.Sometimes, acute kidney injury causes lifelong loss of the use of the kidneys, called end-stage renal disease. People with end-stage renal disease need either lifelong treatments to remove waste from the body, called dialysis, or a kidney transplant to survive.
Death.Acute kidney injury can cause the kidneys to stop working.","You might cut your risk of acute kidney injury by taking care of your kidneys. Try to:
Get treated quickly for bad infections.
Work with your healthcare team to manage kidney and other ongoing conditions.Kidney disease, diabetes or high blood pressure increases your risk of acute kidney injury. If you have one of these, do what your healthcare team tells you to manage your condition.If you have risk factors for kidney disease, check with your healthcare team to be sure that prescription medicines you take are safe for your kidneys.
Read labels when taking pain medicines available without a prescription.Do what the label says when taking medicines such as aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Taking too much of these medicines may increase your risk of kidney injury. This is especially true if you already have kidney disease, diabetes or high blood pressure.
Live a healthy lifestyle.Be active and eat a healthy, balanced diet. If you drink alcohol, drink only in moderation.","You might have the following tests to diagnose acute kidney injury:
Blood tests.A sample of your blood may show fast-rising levels of urea and creatinine. This helps show how your kidneys are working.
Urine output measures.Measuring how much urine you pass in 24 hours may help find the cause of your kidney failure.
Urine tests.A sample of your urine may show something that suggests a condition that might explain kidney failure. This is called urinalysis.
Imaging tests.Imaging tests such as ultrasound and CT scans can show your kidneys.
Removing a sample of kidney tissue for testing.Your healthcare professional may suggest removing a small sample of your kidney tissue for lab testing. This is called a biopsy. A needle put through your skin and into your kidney removes the sample.",Treatment for acute kidney injury most often means a hospital stay. Most people with acute kidney injury are already in the hospital. How long you'll stay in the hospital depends on the reason for your acute kidney injury and how quickly your kidneys recover.,,"Most people are in a hospital when they get acute kidney injury. If you aren't in the hospital and have symptoms of kidney failure, make an appointment with your family healthcare professional right away. You may be referred to a specialist in kidney disease, called a nephrologist.
Before your appointment, write down questions. Consider asking:
What's the most likely cause of my symptoms?
Have my kidneys stopped working? What could have caused my kidney failure?
What tests do I need?
What are my treatment choices, and what are the risks?
Do I need to go to the hospital?
Will my kidneys recover or will I need dialysis?
I have other health conditions. How can I best manage these conditions together?
Do I need to eat a special diet? If so, can you refer me to a dietitian to help me plan what to eat?
Do you have printed materials about acute kidney injury that I can have? What websites do you suggest?","During your recovery from acute kidney injury, a special diet can help support your kidneys and limit the work they must do. Your healthcare team may send you to a dietitian. A dietitian can look at what you eat and suggest ways to make your diet easier on your kidneys.
Your dietitian may suggest that you:
Choose foods lower in potassium.These include apples, peaches, carrots, green beans and white bread and white rice. Eat them instead of foods higher in potassium. These include potatoes, bananas, tomatoes, oranges, beans and nuts.
Don't eat foods with added salt.This includes many packaged foods, such as frozen dinners, canned soups and fast foods. Other foods with added salt include salty snack foods, canned vegetables, and processed meats and cheeses.
Limit phosphorus.Phosphorus is a mineral found in foods, such as dark-colored sodas, milk, oatmeal and bran cereals. Too much phosphorus in your blood can weaken your bones and cause your skin to itch.
As your kidneys get better, you may no longer need a special diet. But healthy eating still is important."
Acute lymphocytic leukemia,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369077,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369083,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia/doctors-departments/ddc-20369085,"Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow — the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made.
The word ""acute"" in acute lymphocytic leukemia comes from the fact that the disease progresses rapidly and creates immature blood cells, rather than mature ones. The word ""lymphocytic"" in acute lymphocytic leukemia refers to the white blood cells called lymphocytes, whichALLaffects. Acute lymphocytic leukemia is also known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Acute lymphocytic leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children, and treatments result in a good chance for a cure. Acute lymphocytic leukemia can also occur in adults, though the chance of a cure is greatly reduced.","Signs and symptoms of acute lymphocytic leukemia may include:
Bleeding from the gums
Bone pain
Fever
Frequent infections
Frequent or severe nosebleeds
Lumps caused by swollen lymph nodes in and around the neck, armpits, abdomen or groin
Pale skin
Shortness of breath
Weakness, fatigue or a general decrease in energy","Make an appointment with your doctor or your child's doctor if you notice any persistent signs and symptoms that concern you.
Many signs and symptoms of acute lymphocytic leukemia mimic those of the flu. However, flu signs and symptoms eventually improve. If signs and symptoms don't improve as expected, make an appointment with your doctor.","Acute lymphocytic leukemia occurs when a bone marrow cell develops changes (mutations) in its genetic material or DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. Normally, the DNA tells the cell to grow at a set rate and to die at a set time. In acute lymphocytic leukemia, the mutations tell the bone marrow cell to continue growing and dividing.
When this happens, blood cell production becomes out of control. The bone marrow produces immature cells that develop into leukemic white blood cells called lymphoblasts. These abnormal cells are unable to function properly, and they can build up and crowd out healthy cells.
It's not clear what causes the DNA mutations that can lead to acute lymphocytic leukemia.","Factors that may increase the risk of acute lymphocytic leukemia include:
Previous cancer treatment.Children and adults who've had certain types of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for other kinds of cancer may have an increased risk of developing acute lymphocytic leukemia.
Exposure to radiation.People exposed to very high levels of radiation, such as survivors of a nuclear reactor accident, have an increased risk of developing acute lymphocytic leukemia.
Genetic disorders.Certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, are associated with an increased risk of acute lymphocytic leukemia.",,,"Tests and procedures used to diagnose acute lymphocytic leukemia include:
Blood tests.Blood tests may reveal too many or too few white blood cells, not enough red blood cells, and not enough platelets. A blood test may also show the presence of blast cells — immature cells normally found in the bone marrow.
Bone marrow test.During bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, a needle is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the hipbone or breastbone. The sample is sent to a lab for testing to look for leukemia cells.Doctors in the lab will classify blood cells into specific types based on their size, shape, and other genetic or molecular features. They also look for certain changes in the cancer cells and determine whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes. This information helps your doctor develop a treatment plan.
Imaging tests.Imaging tests such as an X-ray, a computerized tomography (CT) scan or an ultrasound scan may help determine whether cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord or other parts of the body.
Spinal fluid test.A lumbar puncture test, also called a spinal tap, may be used to collect a sample of spinal fluid — the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. The sample is tested to see whether cancer cells have spread to the spinal fluid.","In general, treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia falls into separate phases:
Induction therapy.The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill most of the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow and to restore normal blood cell production.
Consolidation therapy.Also called post-remission therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying any remaining leukemia in the body.
Maintenance therapy.The third phase of treatment prevents leukemia cells from regrowing. The treatments used in this stage are usually given at much lower doses over a long period of time, often years.
Preventive treatment to the spinal cord.During each phase of therapy, people with acute lymphocytic leukemia may receive additional treatment to kill leukemia cells located in the central nervous system. In this type of treatment, chemotherapy drugs are often injected directly into the fluid that covers the spinal cord.
Depending on your situation, the phases of treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia can span two to three years.
Treatments may include:
Chemotherapy.Chemotherapy, which uses drugs to kill cancer cells, is typically used as an induction therapy for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Chemotherapy drugs can also be used in the consolidation and maintenance phases.

Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy, consolidation therapy or maintenance therapy.
Radiation therapy.Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. If the cancer cells have spread to the central nervous system, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy.
Bone marrow transplant.A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be used as consolidation therapy or for treating relapse if it occurs. This procedure allows someone with leukemia to reestablish healthy bone marrow by replacing leukemic bone marrow with leukemia-free marrow from a healthy person.A bone marrow transplant begins with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation to destroy any leukemia-producing bone marrow. The marrow is then replaced by bone marrow from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).
Engineering immune cells to fight leukemia.A specialized treatment called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy takes your body's germ-fighting T cells, engineers them to fight cancer and infuses them back into your body.CAR-T cell therapy might be an option for children and young adults. It might be used for consolidation therapy or for treating relapse.
Clinical trials.Clinical trials are experiments to test new cancer treatments and new ways of using existing treatments. While clinical trials give you or your child a chance to try the latest cancer treatment, the benefits and risks of the treatment may be uncertain. Discuss the benefits and risks of clinical trials with your doctor.","Treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia can be a long road. Treatment often lasts two to three years, although the first months are the most intense.
During maintenance phases, children can usually live a relatively normal life and go back to school. And adults may be able to continue working. To help you cope, try to:
Learn enough about leukemia to feel comfortable making treatment decisions.Ask your doctor to write down as much information about your specific disease as possible. Then narrow your search for information accordingly.Write down questions you want to ask your doctor before each appointment, and look for information in your local library and on the internet. Good sources include the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.
Lean on your whole health care team.At major medical centers and pediatric cancer centers, your health care team may include psychologists, psychiatrists, recreation therapists, child-life workers, teachers, dietitians, chaplains and social workers. These professionals can help with a whole host of issues, including explaining procedures to children, finding financial assistance and arranging for housing during treatment. Don't hesitate to rely on their expertise.
Explore programs for children with cancer.Major medical centers and nonprofit groups offer numerous activities and services specifically for children with cancer and their families. Examples include summer camps, support groups for siblings and wish-granting programs. Ask your health care team about programs in your area.
Help family and friends understand your situation.Set up a free, personalized webpage at the nonprofit website CaringBridge. This allows you to tell the whole family about appointments, treatments, setbacks and reasons to celebrate — without the stress of calling everyone every time there's something new to report.","Make an appointment with your family doctor if you or your child has signs and symptoms that worry you.

Then narrow your search for information accordingly.Write down questions you want to ask your doctor before each appointment, and look for information in your local library and on the internet. Good sources include the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.
Lean on your whole health care team.At major medical centers and pediatric cancer centers, your health care team may include psychologists, psychiatrists, recreation therapists, child-life workers, teachers, dietitians, chaplains and social workers. These professionals can help with a whole host of issues, including explaining procedures to children, finding financial assistance and arranging for housing during treatment. Don't hesitate to rely on their expertise.
Explore programs for children with cancer.Major medical centers and nonprofit groups offer numerous activities and services specifically for children with cancer and their families. Examples include summer camps, support groups for siblings and wish-granting programs. Ask your health care team about programs in your area.
Help family and friends understand your situation.Set up a free, personalized webpage at the nonprofit website CaringBridge. This allows you to tell the whole family about appointments, treatments, setbacks and reasons to celebrate — without the stress of calling everyone every time there's something new to report.","Make an appointment with your family doctor if you or your child has signs and symptoms that worry you. If your doctor suspects acute lymphocytic leukemia, you'll likely be referred to a doctor who specializes in treating diseases and conditions of the blood and bone marrow (hematologist).
Because appointments can be brief, and because there's often a lot of information to discuss, it's a good idea to be prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready, and what to expect from the doctor.",
Acute myelogenous leukemia,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-myelogenous-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369109,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-myelogenous-leukemia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369115,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-myelogenous-leukemia/doctors-departments/ddc-20369117,"Acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML, is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft matter inside bones where blood cells are made.
The word ""acute"" in acute myelogenous leukemia means the disease tends to get worse quickly. It's called myelogenous (my-uh-LOHJ-uh-nus) leukemia because it affects cells called the myeloid cells. These typically develop into mature blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.
AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. The other type is acute lymphoblastic leukemia, also called ALL. Although AML can be diagnosed at any age, it is less common before age 45. AML also is called acute myeloid leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.
Unlike other cancers, there are no numbered stages of acute myelogenous leukemia.","Symptoms of acute myelogenous leukemia may include:
Fever.
Pain. Common places for pain include the bones, back and stomach.
Feeling very tired.
Paleness or change in skin color.
Frequent infections.
Easy bruising.
Bleeding with no clear cause, such as in the nose or gums.
Shortness of breath.","Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you have ongoing symptoms that worry you. Acute myelogenous leukemia symptoms are like those of many more-common conditions, such as infections. The healthcare professional may check for those causes first.","It's often not clear what causes acute myelogenous leukemia.
Healthcare professionals know that it starts when something causes changes to the DNA inside cells in the bone marrow. The bone marrow is the spongy material inside bones. It's where blood cells are made.
The changes that lead to acute myelogenous leukemia are thought to happen in cells called myeloid cells. Myeloid cells are bone marrow cells that can turn into the blood cells that circulate through the body. Healthy myeloid cells can become:
Red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body.
Platelets, which help stop bleeding.
White blood cells, which help fight infections.
Every cell in the body contains DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. But when the DNA changes happen in the myeloid cells, the changes give different instructions. The myeloid cells start to make a lot of extra cells, and they don't stop.
The DNA changes cause the myeloid cells to make a lot of immature white blood cells, called myeloblasts. The myeloblasts don't work right. They can build up in the bone marrow. They can crowd out healthy blood cells. Without enough healthy blood cells, there might be low oxygen levels in the blood, easy bruising and bleeding, and frequent infections.","Factors that may increase the risk of acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML, include:
Older age.Acute myelogenous leukemia is most common in adults age 65 and older.
Prior cancer treatment.People who've had certain types of chemotherapy and radiation therapy may have a greater risk of AML.
Radiation exposure.People exposed to very high levels of radiation, such as a nuclear reactor accident, have an increased risk of developing AML.
Dangerous chemical exposure.Certain chemicals, such as benzene, are linked to a greater risk of AML.
Smoking cigarettes.AML is linked to cigarette smoke, which contains benzene and other known cancer-causing chemicals.
Other blood disorders.People who've had another blood disorder, such as myelodysplasia, myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera or thrombocythemia, are at greater risk of AML.
Genetic disorders.Certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, are associated with an increased risk of AML.
Family history.People with a close blood relative, such as a sibling, parent or grandparent with a blood or bone marrow disorder are at higher risk for AML.
Many people with AML have no known risk factors, and many people who have risk factors never develop the cancer.",,,"Acute myeloid leukemia diagnosis often begins with an exam that checks for bruising, bleeding in the mouth or gums, infection, and swollen lymph nodes. Other tests include blood and lab tests, bone marrow biopsy, lumbar puncture, and imaging.
Tests and exams to diagnose acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML, include:","Many types of treatment exist for acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML. Treatment depends on several factors, including the subtype of the disease, your age, your overall health, your prognosis and your preferences.
Treatment usually has two phases:
Remission induction therapy.This first phase aims to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow. But it doesn't usually destroy all the leukemia cells. You will need further treatment to keep the disease from coming back.
Consolidation therapy.This phase also is called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy. It aims to kill the remaining leukemia cells. Consolidation therapy is crucial to helping lower the risk of relapse.
Treatments include:
Chemotherapy.Chemotherapy treats cancer with strong medicines. Most chemotherapy medicines are given through a vein. Some come in pill form. Chemotherapy is the main type of remission induction therapy. It also may be used for consolidation therapy.
People with AML usually stay in the hospital during chemotherapy treatments because the medicines kill many healthy blood cells while destroying leukemia cells. If the first chemotherapy cycle doesn't cause remission, it can be repeated.
Side effects of chemotherapy depend on the medicines you're given. Common side effects are nausea and hair loss. Serious, long-term complications may include heart disease, lung damage, fertility problems and other cancers.
Targeted therapy.Targeted therapy for cancer is a treatment that uses medicines that attack specific chemicals in the cancer cells. By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy may be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy during induction therapy.
Bone marrow transplant.A bone marrow transplant, also called a bone marrow stem cell transplant, involves putting healthy bone marrow stem cells into the body. These cells replace cells hurt by chemotherapy and other treatments. A bone marrow stem cell transplant may be used for both remission induction and consolidation therapy.
Before a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor. This is called an allogeneic transplant.
There is an increased risk of infection after a transplant.
Clinical trials.Some people with leukemia choose to enroll in clinical trials to try experimental treatments or new combinations of known therapies.","Acute myelogenous leukemia is a fast-growing cancer that requires quick decision-making. The following tips and resources may help you cope:
Learn enough about acute myelogenous leukemia to make decisions about your care.The term leukemia can be confusing because it refers to a group of cancers that aren't all that alike except that they all affect the bone marrow and blood.You can waste a lot of time researching information that doesn't apply to your kind of leukemia. To avoid that, ask your doctor to write down as many details as possible about your specific disease. Then narrow your search to that disease.Look for information at your local library and on the internet. You can start your information search with the National Cancer Institute and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.
Lean on family, friends and others.Having a support system can help you cope. Get support from people close to you, a formal support group or others coping with cancer.
Take care of yourself.It's easy to get caught up in tests, treatments and procedures. But it's important to take care of yourself, not just the cancer. Try to make time for cooking, watching sports or other favorite activities. Get plenty of sleep, see friends, write in a journal and spend time outside if you can.
Stay active.Receiving a diagnosis of cancer doesn't mean you have to stop doing the things you enjoy. If you feel well enough to do something, do it. Check with your healthcare professional about starting any exercise program.","Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you have symptoms that worry you.

This is called acute radiation sickness. The amount of radiation absorbed by the body, called the absorbed dose, determines how bad the illness will be.
Radiation sickness also is called acute radiation syndrome or radiation poisoning. Radiation sickness is not caused by common medical imaging tests that use low-dose radiation, such as X-rays, CT scans and nuclear medicine scans.
Although radiation sickness is serious and often fatal, it's rare. Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, during World War II, most cases of radiation sickness have occurred after nuclear industrial accidents, such as the 1986 fire that damaged the nuclear power plant at Chernobyl, Ukraine.","The severity of radiation sickness symptoms depends on how much radiation you've absorbed. How much you absorb depends on the strength of the radiated energy, the time of your exposures, and the distance between you and the source of radiation.
Symptoms also are affected by the type of exposure, such as total or partial body. The severity of radiation sickness also depends on how sensitive the affected tissue is. For instance, the gastrointestinal system and bone marrow are highly sensitive to radiation.","An accident or attack that causes radiation sickness would lead to a lot of attention and public concern. If such an event happens, listen to radio, television or online reports to learn about emergency instructions for your area.
If you know you've been overexposed to radiation, seek emergency medical care.","Radiation sickness is caused by being exposed to a high dose of radiation. Radiation is the energy released from atoms as either a wave or a tiny particle of matter.
Radiation sickness happens when high-energy radiation damages or destroys certain cells in the body. Areas of the body most at risk of being affected by high-energy radiation are the bone marrow cells and the lining of the intestinal tract.","Being exposed to a source of high-dose radiation increases the risk of radiation sickness. Sources of high-dose radiation include:
An accident at a nuclear industrial facility.
An attack on a nuclear industrial facility.
A small radioactive device going off.
An explosive device that sends out radioactive material. This is called a dirty bomb.
A nuclear weapon going off.","Having radiation sickness can contribute to both short-term and long-term mental health problems, such as grief, fear and anxiety about:
Experiencing a radioactive accident or attack.
Mourning friends or family who haven't survived.
Dealing with the uncertainty of a mysterious and potentially fatal illness.
Worrying about the eventual risk of cancer due to radiation exposure.","In the event of a radiation emergency, listen to the radio or watch television to hear what protective actions local, state and federal authorities recommend. Those actions depend on the situation, but you will be told to either stay in place or evacuate your area.","When a person has experienced known or probable exposure to a high dose of radiation from an accident or attack, medical personnel take a number of steps to determine the absorbed radiation dose. This information is essential for determining how serious the illness is likely to be, which treatments to use and whether a person is likely to survive.
Information important for determining an absorbed dose includes:
Known exposure.Details about distance from the source of radiation and duration of exposure can help provide a rough estimate of the severity of radiation sickness.
Vomiting and other symptoms.The time between radiation exposure and when vomiting starts is a fairly accurate screening tool to estimate absorbed radiation dose. The shorter the time before vomiting starts, the higher the dose. The severity and timing of other symptoms also may help medical personnel determine the absorbed dose.
Blood tests.Frequent blood tests over several days enable medical personnel to look for drops in disease-fighting white blood cells and unusual changes in the DNA of blood cells. These factors indicate the degree of bone marrow damage, which is determined by the level of an absorbed dose.
Dosimeter.A device called a dosimeter can measure the absorbed dose of radiation but only if it was exposed to the same radiation event as the affected person.
Survey meter.A device such as a Geiger counter can be used to test people to see where in the body radioactive particles are located.
Type of radiation.A part of the larger emergency response to a radioactive accident or attack would include identifying the type of radiation exposure. This information would guide some decisions for treating people with radiation sickness.","The treatment goals for radiation sickness are to prevent further radioactive contamination; treat life-threatening injuries, such as from burns and trauma; reduce symptoms; and manage pain.",,,

Those actions depend on the situation, but you will be told to either stay in place or evacuate your area.","When a person has experienced known or probable exposure to a high dose of radiation from an accident or attack, medical personnel take a number of steps to determine the absorbed radiation dose. This information is essential for determining how serious the illness is likely to be, which treatments to use and whether a person is likely to survive.
Information important for determining an absorbed dose includes:
Known exposure.Details about distance from the source of radiation and duration of exposure can help provide a rough estimate of the severity of radiation sickness.
Vomiting and other symptoms.The time between radiation exposure and when vomiting starts is a fairly accurate screening tool to estimate absorbed radiation dose. The shorter the time before vomiting starts, the higher the dose. The severity and timing of other symptoms also may help medical personnel determine the absorbed dose.
Blood tests.Frequent blood tests over several days enable medical personnel to look for drops in disease-fighting white blood cells and unusual changes in the DNA of blood cells. These factors indicate the degree of bone marrow damage, which is determined by the level of an absorbed dose.
Dosimeter.A device called a dosimeter can measure the absorbed dose of radiation but only if it was exposed to the same radiation event as the affected person.
Survey meter.A device such as a Geiger counter can be used to test people to see where in the body radioactive particles are located.
Type of radiation.A part of the larger emergency response to a radioactive accident or attack would include identifying the type of radiation exposure. This information would guide some decisions for treating people with radiation sickness.","The treatment goals for radiation sickness are to prevent further radioactive contamination; treat life-threatening injuries, such as from burns and trauma; reduce symptoms; and manage pain.",,,
Acute kidney injury,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20369048,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-failure/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369053,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-failure/doctors-departments/ddc-20369054,"Acute kidney injury happens when the kidneys suddenly can't filter waste products from the blood. When the kidneys can't filter wastes, harmful levels of wastes may build up. The blood's chemical makeup may get out of balance.
Acute kidney injury used to be called acute kidney failure. Acute kidney injury is most common in people who are in the hospital, mostly in people who need intensive care.
Acute kidney injury ranges from mild to severe. If severe, ongoing and not treated, it can be fatal. But it also can be reversed. People in otherwise good health may get back typical or nearly typical use of their kidneys.","Symptoms of acute kidney injury may include:
Less urine output.
Fluid buildup, which can cause shortness of breath and swelling in the legs, ankles or feet.
Tiredness.
Confusion or fogginess.
Nausea.
Pain in the belly or in the side below the rib cage.
Weakness.
Irregular heartbeat.
Itching.
Loss of appetite.
Chest pain or pressure.
Seizures or coma in severe cases.
Sometimes acute kidney injury causes no symptoms. Then it may be found through lab tests done for something else.",See your healthcare professional right away or seek emergency care if you have symptoms of acute kidney injury.,"Acute kidney injury can happen when:
You have a condition that slows blood flow to your kidneys.
You have damage to your kidneys.
Your kidneys' urine drainage tubes, called ureters, get blocked.","Acute kidney injury almost always is linked to another medical condition or event. Conditions that can increase your risk of acute kidney injury include:
Ongoing kidney disease, also called chronic kidney disease.
Older age, but it does happen to children.
Being in the hospital, most often for a serious condition that needs intensive care.
Blockages in the blood vessels in your arms or legs, called peripheral artery disease.
Diabetes, especially if it's not controlled.
High blood pressure.
Heart failure.
Liver diseases.
Certain cancers and their treatments.","Complications of acute kidney injury may include:
Fluid buildup.A buildup of fluid in your lungs can cause shortness of breath.
Chest pain.The lining that covers your heart, called the pericardium, can get inflamed. This can cause chest pain.
Muscle weakness.This can result from the body's fluids and minerals in the blood called electrolytes being out of balance.
Permanent kidney damage.Sometimes, acute kidney injury causes lifelong loss of the use of the kidneys, called end-stage renal disease. People with end-stage renal disease need either lifelong treatments to remove waste from the body, called dialysis, or a kidney transplant to survive.
Death.Acute kidney injury can cause the kidneys to stop working.","You might cut your risk of acute kidney injury by taking care of your kidneys. Try to:
Get treated quickly for bad infections.
Work with your healthcare team to manage kidney and other ongoing conditions.Kidney disease, diabetes or high blood pressure increases your risk of acute kidney injury. If you have one of these, do what your healthcare team tells you to manage your condition.If you have risk factors for kidney disease, check with your healthcare team to be sure that prescription medicines you take are safe for your kidneys.
Read labels when taking pain medicines available without a prescription.Do what the label says when taking medicines such as aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Taking too much of these medicines may increase your risk of kidney injury. This is especially true if you already have kidney disease, diabetes or high blood pressure.
Live a healthy lifestyle.Be active and eat a healthy, balanced diet. If you drink alcohol, drink only in moderation.","You might have the following tests to diagnose acute kidney injury:
Blood tests.A sample of your blood may show fast-rising levels of urea and creatinine. This helps show how your kidneys are working.
Urine output measures.Measuring how much urine you pass in 24 hours may help find the cause of your kidney failure.
Urine tests.A sample of your urine may show something that suggests a condition that might explain kidney failure. This is called urinalysis.
Imaging tests.Imaging tests such as ultrasound and CT scans can show your kidneys.
Removing a sample of kidney tissue for testing.Your healthcare professional may suggest removing a small sample of your kidney tissue for lab testing. This is called a biopsy. A needle put through your skin and into your kidney removes the sample.",Treatment for acute kidney injury most often means a hospital stay. Most people with acute kidney injury are already in the hospital. How long you'll stay in the hospital depends on the reason for your acute kidney injury and how quickly your kidneys recover.,,"Most people are in a hospital when they get acute kidney injury. If you aren't in the hospital and have symptoms of kidney failure, make an appointment with your family healthcare professional right away. You may be referred to a specialist in kidney disease, called a nephrologist.
Before your appointment, write down questions. Consider asking:
What's the most likely cause of my symptoms?
Have my kidneys stopped working? What could have caused my kidney failure?
What tests do I need?
What are my treatment choices, and what are the risks?
Do I need to go to the hospital?
Will my kidneys recover or will I need dialysis?
I have other health conditions. How can I best manage these conditions together?
Do I need to eat a special diet? If so, can you refer me to a dietitian to help me plan what to eat?
Do you have printed materials about acute kidney injury that I can have? What websites do you suggest?","During your recovery from acute kidney injury, a special diet can help support your kidneys and limit the work they must do. Your healthcare team may send you to a dietitian. A dietitian can look at what you eat and suggest ways to make your diet easier on your kidneys.
Your dietitian may suggest that you:
Choose foods lower in potassium.These include apples, peaches, carrots, green beans and white bread and white rice. Eat them instead of foods higher in potassium. These include potatoes, bananas, tomatoes, oranges, beans and nuts.
Don't eat foods with added salt.This includes many packaged foods, such as frozen dinners, canned soups and fast foods. Other foods with added salt include salty snack foods, canned vegetables, and processed meats and cheeses.
Limit phosphorus.Phosphorus is a mineral found in foods, such as dark-colored sodas, milk, oatmeal and bran cereals. Too much phosphorus in your blood can weaken your bones and cause your skin to itch.
As your kidneys get better, you may no longer need a special diet. But healthy eating still is important."
ARDS,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ards/symptoms-causes/syc-20355576,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ards/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355581,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ards/doctors-departments/ddc-20355584,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs when lung swelling causes fluid to build up in the tiny elastic air sacs in the lungs. These air sacs, called alveoli, have a protective membrane, but lung swelling damages that membrane. The fluid leaking into the air sacs keeps the lungs from filling with enough air. This means less oxygen reaches the bloodstream, so the body's organs don't get the oxygen they need to work properly.
ARDS usually occurs in people who are already critically ill or have major injuries. People usually are severely short of breath — the main symptom of ARDS — within a few hours to a few days after the injury or infection that caused ARDS.
Many people who get ARDS don't survive. The risk of death gets higher with age and how severe the illness is. Of the people who survive ARDS, some fully recover. But others have lasting lung damage.","The seriousness of ARDS symptoms can vary depending on what's causing them and whether there is underlying heart or lung disease. Symptoms include:
Severe shortness of breath.
Labored and rapid breathing that is not usual.
Cough.
Chest discomfort.
Fast heart rate.
Confusion and extreme tiredness.","ARDS usually follows a major illness or injury, and most people who have ARDS are already in a hospital. But if you have symptoms of ARDS and are not in a medical facility, go to the nearest emergency department right away or call 911 or your local emergency number for help.","Causes of ARDS include:
Sepsis.The most common cause of ARDS is sepsis, a serious and widespread infection of the bloodstream.
Severe pneumonia.Severe cases of pneumonia usually affect all five lobes of the lungs.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).People who have severe COVID-19 may get ARDS. Because COVID-19 mainly affects the respiratory system, it can cause lung injury and swelling that can lead to COVID-19-related ARDS.
Head, chest or other major injury.Accidents, such as falls or car crashes, can damage the lungs or the portion of the brain that controls breathing.
Breathing in harmful substances.Breathing in a lot of smoke or chemical fumes can lead to ARDS, as can breathing in vomit. Breathing in water in cases of near-drownings also can cause ARDS.
Other conditions and treatments.Swelling of the pancreas (pancreatitis), massive blood transfusions and severe burns can lead to ARDS.","Most people who get ARDS already are in a hospital for another condition. Many are critically ill. People are especially at risk if they have an infection, such as sepsis or pneumonia. They're also at higher risk if they have COVID-19, especially if they also have metabolic syndrome.
People who have alcohol use disorder or who use recreational drugs or smoke ― lifestyle habits that can harm the lungs ― are at higher risk of getting ARDS. Having a history of alcohol, drug or tobacco use also raises the risk of ARDS.","ARDS can cause other medical problems while in the hospital, including:
Blood clots.Lying still in the hospital while you're on a ventilator can make it more likely that you'll get blood clots, particularly in the deep veins in your legs. If a clot forms in your leg, a portion of it can break off and travel to one or both of your lungs, where it can block blood flow. This is called a pulmonary embolism.
Collapsed lung, also called pneumothorax.In most people with ARDS, a breathing machine called a ventilator brings more oxygen into the body and forces fluid out of the lungs. But the pressure and air volume of the ventilator can force gas to go through a small hole in the very outside of a lung and cause that lung to collapse.
Infections.A ventilator attaches to a tube inserted in your windpipe. This makes it much easier for germs to infect and injure your lungs.
Scarred and damaged lungs, known as pulmonary fibrosis.Scarring and thickening of the tissue between the air sacs in the lungs can occur within a few weeks of the start of ARDS. This makes your lungs stiffer, and it's even harder for oxygen to flow from the air sacs into your bloodstream.
Stress ulcers.Extra acid that your stomach makes because of serious illness or injury can irritate the stomach lining and lead to ulcers.
Thanks to better treatments, more people are surviving ARDS. But many survivors end up with potentially serious and sometimes lasting effects:
Breathing problems.After having ARDS, many people get most of their lung function back within several months to several years, but others may have breathing problems for the rest of their lives. Even people who do well usually have shortness of breath and fatigue and may need extra oxygen at home for a few months.
Depression.Most ARDS survivors also report going through a period of depression, which can be treated.
Problems with memory and thinking clearly.Sedatives and low levels of oxygen in the blood can lead to memory loss and learning problems after ARDS. In some people, the effects may get better over time. But in others, the damage may last for the rest of their lives.
Tiredness and muscle weakness.Being in the hospital and on a ventilator can cause your muscles to weaken. You also may feel very tired after treatment.",,"There's no specific test for ARDS. Healthcare professionals base the diagnosis on physical exams, chest X-rays and oxygen levels. It's also important to rule out other diseases and conditions, such as certain heart problems that can lead to similar symptoms.","The first goal in treating ARDS is to improve the levels of oxygen in your blood. Without oxygen, your organs can't work properly.","Recovery from ARDS can take time, and you're likely to need plenty of support. Although everyone's recovery is different, being aware of common challenges that others with the condition have had can help.
Consider these tips:
Ask for help.Be sure you have help with everyday tasks until you know what you can manage on your own. This is particularly important when you come home from the hospital.
Join a support group.There are support groups for people with lifelong lung problems. Discover what's available in your community or online and consider joining others with similar experiences.
Seek professional help.If you have symptoms of depression, such as hopelessness and loss of interest in your usual activities, tell your healthcare professional or contact a mental health professional. Depression is common in people who have had ARDS, and treatment can help.",,"If you're recovering from ARDS, these suggestions can help protect your lungs:
Quit smoking.If you smoke, seek help to quit. Also, stay away from secondhand smoke whenever you can.
Get vaccinated.Getting the flu, also called influenza, shot every year, as well as the pneumonia vaccine as often as recommended, can lower your risk of lung infections.
Attend pulmonary rehabilitation.Many medical centers now offer pulmonary rehabilitation programs that include exercise training, education and counseling to help you learn how to get back to your usual activities and get to your ideal weight."

Acute sinusitis makes it hard for the sinuses to drain. Mucus builds up.
Acute sinusitis can make it hard to breathe through the nose. The area around the eyes and the face might feel swollen. There might be throbbing face pain or a headache.
The common cold is the usual cause of acute sinusitis. Most often, the condition clears up within a week to 10 days unless there's also an infection caused by bacteria, called a bacterial infection. Home remedies might be all that's needed to treat acute sinusitis. Sinusitis that lasts more than 12 weeks even with medical treatment is called chronic sinusitis.","Acute sinusitis symptoms often include:
Thick, yellow or greenish mucus from the nose, known as a runny nose, or down the back of the throat, known as postnasal drip.
Blocked or stuffy nose, known as congestion. This makes it hard to breathe through the nose.
Pain, tenderness, swelling and pressure around the eyes, cheeks, nose or forehead that gets worse when bending over.
Other signs and symptoms include:
Ear pressure.
Headache.
Aching in the teeth.
Changed sense of smell.
Cough.
Bad breath.
Tiredness.
Fever.","Most people with acute sinusitis don't need to see a health care provider.

Double vision or other vision changes.
Stiff neck.","Acute sinusitis is an infection caused by a virus. The common cold is most often the cause. Sometimes, sinuses that are blocked for a time might get a bacterial infection.","The following can raise the risk of getting sinusitis:
Hay fever or another allergythat affects the sinuses.
A common coldthat affects the sinuses.
A problem inside the nose,such as a deviated nasal septum, nasal polyps or tumors.
A medical conditionsuch as cystic fibrosis or an immune system disorder such as HIV/AIDS.
Being around smoke,either from smoking or being around others who smoke, known as secondhand smoke.","Acute sinusitis doesn't often cause complications. Complications that might happen include:
Chronic sinusitis.Acute sinusitis can be a flare-up of a long-term problem known as chronic sinusitis. Chronic sinusitis lasts longer than 12 weeks.
Meningitis.This infection affects the membranes and fluid around the brain and spinal cord.
Other infections.It's not common. But an infection can spread to the bones, known as osteomyelitis, or to skin, known as cellulitis.
Vision problems.If the infection spreads to the eye socket, it can reduce vision or cause blindness.","Take these steps to help lower your risk of getting acute sinusitis:
Stay well.Try to stay away from people who have colds or other infections. Wash your hands often with soap and water, such as before meals.
Manage allergies.Work with your health care provider to keep symptoms under control.
Avoid cigarette smoke and polluted air.Tobacco smoke and other pollutants can irritate lungs and inside the nose, known as nasal passages.
Use a machine that adds moisture to the air, known as a humidifier.If the air in your home is dry, adding moisture to the air may help prevent sinusitis. Be sure the humidifier stays clean and free of mold with regular, complete cleaning.","A health care provider might ask about symptoms and do an exam. The exam might include feeling for tenderness in the nose and face and looking inside the nose.
Other ways to diagnose acute sinusitis and rule out other conditions include:
Nasal endoscopy.A health care provider inserts a thin, flexible tube, known as an endoscope, into the nose. A light on the tube allows the provider to see inside the sinuses.
Imaging studies.A CT scan can show details of the sinuses and nasal area. It's not usually used for simple acute sinusitis. But imaging studies might help rule out other causes.
Nasal and sinus samples.Lab tests aren't often used to diagnose acute sinusitis. But if the condition doesn't get better with treatment or gets worse, tissue samples from the nose or sinuses might help find the cause.",Most cases of acute sinusitis get better on their own. Self-care is usually all that's needed to ease symptoms.,,Here's information to help you get ready for your appointment.,"These steps can help relieve sinusitis symptoms:
Rest.Rest helps the body fight infection and speed recovery.
Drink fluids.Keep drinking plenty of fluids.
Use a warm compress.A warm compress on the nose and forehead might help lessen pressure in the sinuses.
Keep sinuses moist.Breathing in the steam from a bowl of hot water with a towel over the head might help. Or take a hot shower, breathing in the warm, moist air. This will help ease pain and help mucus drain.
Rinse the inside of the nose.Use a specially designed squeeze bottle (Sinus Rinse, others) or neti pot. This home remedy, called nasal lavage, can help clear sinuses."
Autoimmune epilepsy,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autoimmune-epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20576892,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autoimmune-epilepsy/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20576912,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autoimmune-epilepsy/doctors-departments/ddc-20576934,"Autoimmune epilepsy is a type of epilepsy where seizures are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking brain cells. It can occur with conditions that affect the immune system, especially autoimmune encephalitis.
Autoimmune epilepsy also is known as autoimmune associated epilepsy and acute symptomatic seizures secondary to autoimmune encephalitis.
The immune system protects the body from viruses, bacteria and other substances that can cause illnesses. Antibodies are proteins that are part of the immune system. In autoimmune epilepsy, antibodies mistakenly target receptors in the brain. This leads to swelling in the brain, also known as inflammation, and seizures.
Antiseizure medicines usually don't do enough to manage seizures in people with autoimmune epilepsy. Instead, immunotherapy medicines help reduce the immune response on the brain.
When immunotherapy is started early, it can reduce inflammation and improve seizures. For some people, treatment can stop seizures completely. For others, seizures may continue after treatment.","Symptoms of autoimmune epilepsy may begin after an illness with a fever. Seizures come on suddenly and are serious. The types of seizures that may occur include:
Focal seizures.These are the most common type of seizure in autoimmune epilepsy. Sometimes focal seizures cause a change or loss of awareness. The seizures may cause the person to stare and not respond to the environment. Other types of focal seizures don't cause a change in awareness. These seizures cause different symptoms depending on which part of the brain causes them. Focal seizures may cause one part of the body to shake. Or they may cause a feeling that his has happened before, known as déjà vu. Focal seizures also may cause nausea or vision symptoms, such as flashing lights.
Faciobrachial dystonic seizures.These seizures cause muscle contractions on one side of the face and in an arm, both on the same side of the body.
Symptoms related to seizures include:
Seizures that happen several times a day.
Seizures that don't go away with antiseizure medicines.
Seizures that last more than five minutes or that occur close together without the person regaining consciousness, known as status epilepticus.
Autoimmune epilepsy symptoms also may include:
Memory loss and trouble with thinking.
Personality and behavior changes.
Involuntary movements or clumsy movements.
Irregular eye movements.
Changes in heart rate, blood pressure and other automatic functions.","Get emergency medical care if you or someone you are with has a seizure that lasts more than five minutes or if seizures occur one after another with a loss of consciousness. Also seek emergency medical care for high fevers or trouble breathing.
See your healthcare professional right away if you have had a seizure for the first time or if you have other symptoms of autoimmune epilepsy.","Autoimmune epilepsy is caused by the immune system attacking brain cells and leading to seizures. Antibodies are part of the immune system. They usually protect the body from viruses and infections. But in autoimmune conditions, the immune system attacks healthy cells. More recently, research has concluded that epilepsy can be an autoimmune disease.
Autoimmune epilepsy causes may include:
Autoimmune encephalitis.Autoimmune encephalitis (en-sef-uh-LIE-tis) is a group of conditions that causes swelling in the brain. This happens because the immune system mistakenly attacks brain cells. Autoimmune encephalitis causes a variety of symptoms, including seizures. It is the most common cause of autoimmune epilepsy. Certain types of autoimmune encephalitis are commonly linked to autoimmune epilepsy and are associated with antibodies that target NMDA-receptors, LGI1, CASPR2 and GAD65.
Rasmussen syndrome.In this condition, immune cells known as T cells cause inflammation and brain damage that lead to seizures. People with autoimmune epilepsy due to Rasmussen syndrome may continue to have seizures after treatment.
Cancer.Sometimes tumors trigger the immune system to attack healthy brain cells, known as paraneoplastic syndrome. This can lead to epilepsy.","The risk of autoimmune epilepsy is low, but it can occur in both adults and children. Risk factors include:
Having another autoimmune disease. These may include rheumatoid arthritis, Graves' disease, Hashimoto thyroiditis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or lupus.
Having a history of cancer.
Having a parent, sibling or child with an autoimmune disease.","Autoimmune epilepsy complications can include serious seizures that last more than five minutes or occur one after another. The person isn't conscious in between the seizures. These serious seizures are known as status epilepticus. They need emergency medical attention.
Sometimes autoimmune epilepsy can lead to seizures that don't stop with treatment.","You may not be able to prevent autoimmune epilepsy. But getting cancer screenings can help your healthcare professional find tumors and treat them early. This could prevent autoimmune encephalitis triggered by cancers, which can be a cause of epilepsy. Talk with your healthcare professional about your cancer risk and if you should get screened for certain cancers.","An autoimmune epilepsy diagnosis begins with a physical exam and a review of your symptoms.
Testings for autoimmune epilepsy includes lab tests, brain imaging and testing the electrical activity in the brain.","Autoimmune epilepsy treatment differs from the treatment used for other types of epilepsy. Healthcare professionals use immunotherapy to reduce the immune system activity and treat seizures.
If cancer is the cause of autoimmune epilepsy, treating the cancer is an important part of treatment.",,"If your symptoms are serious, you might need emergency medical care.
If your symptoms are less serious, you may start by seeing your healthcare professional. Or you may be referred right away to a doctor who specializes in nervous system conditions, known as a neurologist.",
Alcohol use disorder,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-use-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20369243,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-use-disorder/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369250,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-use-disorder/doctors-departments/ddc-20369252,"Alcohol use disorder is a pattern of alcohol use that involves problems controlling your drinking, being preoccupied with alcohol or continuing to use alcohol even when it causes problems. This disorder also involves having to drink more to get the same effect or having withdrawal symptoms when you rapidly decrease or stop drinking. Alcohol use disorder includes a level of drinking that's sometimes called alcoholism.
Unhealthy alcohol use includes any alcohol use that puts your health or safety at risk or causes other alcohol-related problems. It also includes binge drinking — a pattern of drinking where a male has five or more drinks within two hours or a female has at least four drinks within two hours. Binge drinking causes significant health and safety risks.
If your pattern of drinking results in repeated significant distress and problems functioning in your daily life, you likely have alcohol use disorder. It can range from mild to severe. However, even a mild disorder can escalate and lead to serious problems, so early treatment is important.","Alcohol use disorder can be mild, moderate or severe, based on the number of symptoms you experience. Signs and symptoms may include:
Being unable to limit the amount of alcohol you drink
Wanting to cut down on how much you drink or making unsuccessful attempts to do so
Spending a lot of time drinking, getting alcohol or recovering from alcohol use
Feeling a strong craving or urge to drink alcohol
Failing to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home due to repeated alcohol use
Continuing to drink alcohol even though you know it's causing physical, social, work or relationship problems
Giving up or reducing social and work activities and hobbies to use alcohol
Using alcohol in situations where it's not safe, such as when driving or swimming
Developing a tolerance to alcohol so you need more to feel its effect or you have a reduced effect from the same amount
Experiencing withdrawal symptoms — such as nausea, sweating and shaking — when you don't drink, or drinking to avoid these symptoms
Alcohol use disorder can include periods of being drunk (alcohol intoxication) and symptoms of withdrawal.
Alcohol intoxicationresults as the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream increases. The higher the blood alcohol concentration is, the more likely you are to have bad effects. Alcohol intoxication causes behavior problems and mental changes. These may include inappropriate behavior, unstable moods, poor judgment, slurred speech, problems with attention or memory, and poor coordination. You can also have periods called ""blackouts,"" where you don't remember events. Very high blood alcohol levels can lead to coma, permanent brain damage or even death.
Alcohol withdrawalcan occur when alcohol use has been heavy and prolonged and is then stopped or greatly reduced. It can occur within several hours to 4 to 5 days later. Signs and symptoms include sweating, rapid heartbeat, hand tremors, problems sleeping, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, restlessness and agitation, anxiety, and occasionally seizures. Symptoms can be severe enough to impair your ability to function at work or in social situations.","If you feel that you sometimes drink too much alcohol, or your drinking is causing problems, or if your family is concerned about your drinking, talk with your health care provider. Other ways to get help include talking with a mental health professional or seeking help from a support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar type of self-help group.
Because denial is common, you may feel like you don't have a problem with drinking. You might not recognize how much you drink or how many problems in your life are related to alcohol use. Listen to relatives, friends or co-workers when they ask you to examine your drinking habits or to seek help. Consider talking with someone who has had a problem with drinking but has stopped.","Genetic, psychological, social and environmental factors can impact how drinking alcohol affects your body and behavior. Theories suggest that for certain people drinking has a different and stronger impact that can lead to alcohol use disorder.
Over time, drinking too much alcohol may change the normal function of the areas of your brain associated with the experience of pleasure, judgment and the ability to exercise control over your behavior. This may result in craving alcohol to try to restore good feelings or reduce negative ones.","Alcohol use may begin in the teens, but alcohol use disorder occurs more frequently in the 20s and 30s, though it can start at any age.
Risk factors for alcohol use disorder include:
Steady drinking over time.Drinking too much on a regular basis for an extended period or binge drinking on a regular basis can lead to alcohol-related problems or alcohol use disorder.
Starting at an early age.People who begin drinking — especially binge drinking — at an early age are at a higher risk of alcohol use disorder.
Family history.The risk of alcohol use disorder is higher for people who have a parent or other close relative who has problems with alcohol. This may be influenced by genetic factors.
Depression and other mental health problems.It's common for people with a mental health disorder such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder to have problems with alcohol or other substances.
History of trauma.People with a history of emotional trauma or other trauma are at increased risk of alcohol use disorder.
Having bariatric surgery.Some research studies indicate that having bariatric surgery may increase the risk of developing alcohol use disorder or of relapsing after recovering from alcohol use disorder.
Social and cultural factors.Having friends or a close partner who drinks regularly could increase your risk of alcohol use disorder. The glamorous way that drinking is sometimes portrayed in the media also may send the message that it's OK to drink too much. For young people, the influence of parents, peers and other role models can impact risk.","Alcohol depresses your central nervous system. In some people, the initial reaction may feel like an increase in energy. But as you continue to drink, you become drowsy and have less control over your actions.
Too much alcohol affects your speech, muscle coordination and vital centers of your brain. A heavy drinking binge may even cause a life-threatening coma or death. This is of particular concern when you're taking certain medications that also depress the brain's function.","Early intervention can prevent alcohol-related problems in teens. If you have a teenager, be alert to signs and symptoms that may indicate a problem with alcohol:
Loss of interest in activities and hobbies and in personal appearance
Red eyes, slurred speech, problems with coordination and memory lapses
Difficulties or changes in relationships with friends, such as joining a new crowd
Declining grades and problems in school
Frequent mood changes and defensive behavior
You can help prevent teenage alcohol use:
Set a good example with your own alcohol use.
Talk openly with your child, spend quality time together and become actively involved in your child's life.
Let your child know what behavior you expect — and what the consequences will be for not following the rules.","You're likely to start by seeing your primary health care provider. If your provider suspects that you have a problem with alcohol, you may be referred to a mental health provider.
To assess your problem with alcohol, your provider will likely:
Ask you some questions related to your drinking habits.The provider may ask for permission to speak with family members or friends. However, confidentiality laws prevent your provider from giving out any information about you without your consent.
Perform a physical exam.Your health care provider may do a physical exam and ask questions about your health. There are many physical signs that indicate complications of alcohol use.
Suggest lab tests and imaging tests.While there are no specific tests to diagnose alcohol use disorder, certain patterns of lab test results may strongly suggest it. And you may need tests to identify health problems that may be linked to your alcohol use. Damage to your organs may be seen on tests.
Complete a psychological evaluation.This evaluation includes questions about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may be asked to complete a questionnaire to help answer these questions.","Treatment for alcohol use disorder can vary, depending on your needs. Treatment may involve a brief intervention, individual or group counseling, an outpatient program, or a residential inpatient stay. Working to stop alcohol use to improve quality of life is the main treatment goal.
Treatment for alcohol use disorder may include:
Detox and withdrawal.Treatment may begin with a program of detoxification — withdrawal that's medically managed. Sometimes called detox, this generally takes 2 to 7 days. You may need to take sedating medications to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Detox is usually done at an inpatient treatment center or a hospital.
Learning new skills and making a treatment plan.This process usually involves alcohol treatment specialists. It may include goal setting, behavior change techniques, use of self-help manuals, counseling and follow-up care at a treatment center.
Psychological counseling.Counseling and therapy for groups and individuals help you better understand your problem with alcohol and support recovery from the psychological aspects of alcohol use. You may benefit from couples or family therapy — family support can be an important part of the recovery process.
Oral medications.A drug called disulfiram may help prevent you from drinking, although it won't cure alcohol use disorder or remove the urge to drink. If you drink alcohol while taking disulfiram, the drug produces a physical reaction that may include flushing, nausea, vomiting and headaches.Naltrexone, a drug that blocks the good feelings alcohol causes, may prevent heavy drinking and reduce the urge to drink. Acamprosate may help you combat alcohol cravings once you stop drinking. Unlike disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate don't make you feel sick after taking a drink.
Injected medication.Vivitrol, a version of the drug naltrexone, is injected once a month by a health care professional. Although similar medication can be taken in pill form, the injectable version of the drug may be easier for people recovering from alcohol use disorder to use consistently.
Continuing support.Aftercare programs and support groups help people recovering from alcohol use disorder to stop drinking, manage relapses and cope with necessary lifestyle changes. This may include medical or psychological care or attending a support group.
Treatment for psychological problems.Alcohol use disorder commonly occurs along with other mental health disorders. If you have depression, anxiety or another mental health condition, you may need talk therapy (psychotherapy), medications or other treatment.
Medical treatment for health conditions.Many alcohol-related health problems improve significantly once you stop drinking. But some health conditions may warrant continued treatment and follow-up care.
Spiritual practice.People who are involved with some type of regular spiritual practice may find it easier to maintain recovery from alcohol use disorder or other addictions. For many people, gaining greater insight into their spiritual side is a key element in recovery.","Many people with alcohol problems and their family members find that participating in support groups is an essential part of coping with the disease, preventing or dealing with relapses, and staying sober. Your health care provider or counselor can suggest a support group. These groups are also often listed on the web.
Here are a few examples:
Alcoholics Anonymous.Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a self-help group for people recovering from alcoholism. AA offers a sober peer group and is built around 12 steps as an effective model for achieving total abstinence.
Women for Sobriety.Women for Sobriety is a nonprofit organization offering a self-help group program for women who want to overcome alcoholism and other addictions. It focuses on developing coping skills related to emotional and spiritual growth, self-esteem, and a healthy lifestyle.
Al-Anon and Alateen.Al-Anon is designed for people who are affected by someone else's alcoholism. Alateen groups are available for teenage children of those with alcoholism. In sharing their stories, family members gain a greater understanding of how the disease affects the entire family.
Celebrate Recovery.Celebrate Recovery is a Christ-centered, 12-step recovery program for people struggling with addiction.
SMART Recovery.SMART Recovery offers mutual support meetings for people seeking science-based, self-empowered addiction recovery.","Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment, and what to expect from your health care provider or mental health provider.
Consider your drinking habits. Take an honest look at how often and how much you drink. Be prepared to discuss any problems that alcohol may be causing. You may want to take a family member or friend along, if possible.
Before your appointment, make a list of:
Any symptoms you've had,including any that may seem unrelated to your drinking
Key personal information,including any major stresses or recent life changes
All medications,vitamins, herbs or other supplements that you're taking and their dosages
Questions to askyour provider
Some questions to ask include:
Do you think I drink too much or show signs of problem drinking?
Do you think I need to cut back or quit drinking?
Do you think alcohol could be causing or worsening my other health problems?
What's the best course of action?
What are the alternatives to the approach that you're suggesting?
Do I need any medical tests for underlying physical problems?
Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can have? What websites do you recommend?
Would it be helpful for me to meet with a professional experienced in alcohol treatment?
Don't hesitate to ask any other questions.","As part of your recovery, you'll need to focus on changing your habits and making different lifestyle choices. These strategies may help:
Consider your social situation.Make it clear to your friends and family that you're not drinking alcohol. Develop a support system of friends and family who can support your recovery. You may need to distance yourself from friends and social situations that impair your recovery.
Develop healthy habits.For example, good sleep, regular physical activity, managing stress more effectively and eating well all can make it easier for you to recover from alcohol use disorder.
Do things that don't involve alcohol.You may find that many of your activities involve drinking. Replace them with hobbies or activities that are not centered around alcohol."
Compulsive gambling,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/compulsive-gambling/symptoms-causes/syc-20355178,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/compulsive-gambling/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355184,,"Compulsive gambling, also called gambling disorder, is the uncontrollable urge to keep gambling despite the toll it takes on your life. Gambling means that you're willing to risk something you value in the hope of getting something of even greater value.

Gambling can stimulate the brain's reward system much like drugs or alcohol can, leading to addiction. If you have a problem with compulsive gambling, you may continually chase bets that lead to losses, use up savings and create debt. You may hide your behavior and even turn to theft or fraud to support your addiction.

Compulsive gambling is a serious condition that can destroy lives. Although treating compulsive gambling can be challenging, many people who struggle with compulsive gambling have found help through professional treatment.","Signs and symptoms of compulsive gambling (gambling disorder) can include:

Most casual gamblers stop when losing or set a limit on how much they're willing to lose. But people with a compulsive gambling problem are compelled to keep playing to recover their money — a pattern that becomes increasingly destructive over time. Some people may turn to theft or fraud to get gambling money.

Some people with a compulsive gambling problem may have periods of remission — a length of time where they gamble less or not at all. But without treatment, the remission usually isn't permanent.",,"Exactly what causes someone to gamble compulsively isn't well understood. Like many problems, compulsive gambling may result from a combination of biological, genetic and environmental factors.","Although most people who play cards or wager never develop a gambling problem, certain factors are more often associated with compulsive gambling:","Compulsive gambling can have profound and long-lasting consequences for your life, such as:","Although there's no proven way to prevent a gambling problem, educational programs that target individuals and groups at increased risk may be helpful.

If you have risk factors for compulsive gambling, consider avoiding gambling in any form, people who gamble and places where gambling occurs. Get treatment at the earliest sign of a problem to help prevent gambling from becoming worse.","If you recognize that you may have a problem with gambling, talk with your health care provider about an evaluation or seek help from a mental health professional.

To evaluate your problem with gambling, your health care provider or mental health provider will likely:","Treating compulsive gambling can be challenging. That's partly because most people have a hard time admitting they have a problem. Yet a major part of treatment is working on acknowledging that you're a compulsive gambler.

If your family or your employer pressured you into therapy, you may find yourself resisting treatment. But treating a gambling problem can help you regain a sense of control — and possibly help heal damaged relationships or finances.

Treatment for compulsive gambling may include these approaches:

Treatment for compulsive gambling may involve an outpatient program, inpatient program or a residential treatment program, depending on your needs and resources. Self-help treatments such as structured internet-based programs and telephone visits with a mental health professional may be an option for some people.

Treatment for substance misuse, depression, anxiety or any other mental health issue may be part of your treatment plan for compulsive gambling.","These recovery skills may help you to resist the urges of compulsive gambling

Family members of people with a compulsive gambling problem may benefit from counseling, even if the gambler is unwilling to participate in therapy.","If you've decided to seek help for compulsive gambling, you've taken an important first step.",
Nicotine dependence,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nicotine-dependence/symptoms-causes/syc-20351584,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nicotine-dependence/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351590,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nicotine-dependence/doctors-departments/ddc-20351594,"Nicotine dependence happens when your body craves nicotine and you can't stop using it. Nicotine is the chemical in smoked tobacco that causes the urge to smoke. The chemical brings on pleasant feelings, but these effects are short-lived. So you have another cigarette, cigar or pipe bowl.
The more you use smoked tobacco, the more nicotine you need to feel good. When you try to stop, you go through mental and physical changes that aren't pleasant. These are symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.
For some people, using any amount of smoked tobacco can quickly lead to nicotine dependence. But no matter how long you've used nicotine, stopping can improve your health. It isn't easy, but you can break your dependence on nicotine. There are treatment options. Ask your healthcare professional for help.","Symptoms of nicotine dependence can include the following:
You can't stop smoking.You've made one or more serious attempts to stop without long-term success.
You smoke within 30 minutes of waking up.The sooner you start smoking after waking and the more cigarettes you smoke during the day, the more dependent on nicotine you are.
You have nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you try to stop.Your attempts at stopping have caused physical and mood-related symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can include strong cravings, anxiety, irritable mood, restlessness, trouble focusing or sleeping, depression, frustration, anger, increased hunger, and constipation.
You keep smoking despite health conditions.Even though you've developed health conditions linked to smoking, you haven't been able to stop.
You give up social activities.You may stop going to smoke-free restaurants or stop socializing with family or friends because you can't smoke in these situations.","Talk with your healthcare professional if you've tried to stop smoking but haven't been able to stop for good. Most people who smoke make many attempts to stop smoking before they're able to quit long-term.
A treatment plan that includes medicine and counseling with a tobacco treatment specialist can boost your chances of success. Ask your healthcare team for a treatment plan that works for you. Or ask where to get help with stopping smoking.","Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that keeps you smoking tobacco. Nicotine reaches the brain within seconds of taking a puff. In the brain, nicotine increases the release of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters. These brain chemicals help control mood and behavior.
When you're using nicotine, the reward center in your brain releases a neurotransmitter called dopamine. Dopamine causes feelings of pleasure and improved mood.
The more you smoke, the more nicotine you need to feel good. Nicotine quickly becomes part of your daily routine and affects your habits and feelings.
Common situations that trigger the urge to smoke include:
Drinking coffee or taking breaks at work.
Talking on the phone.
Drinking alcohol.
Driving your car.
Spending time with friends.
To overcome your nicotine dependence, you need to become aware of your triggers and make a plan for dealing with them.","Anyone who smokes or uses other forms of tobacco is at risk of becoming dependent. Factors that influence who is likely to use tobacco include:
Age.Most people begin smoking during childhood or the teen years. The younger you are when you begin smoking, the greater the chance of nicotine dependence.
Genetics.The genes passed from parents to children may play a role in the chance of a person becoming dependent on nicotine.
Parents and peers.Children who grow up with parents who smoke are more likely to smoke. Children with friends who smoke also are more likely to try it.
Depression or anxiety.Some people who have mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety try to get relief by smoking. But smoking cigarettes doesn't help relieve symptoms of these conditions.
Substance use.People who use alcohol and illicit drugs are more likely to smoke.","Tobacco smoke has hundreds of harmful chemicals in it. At least 69 of those chemicals can cause cancer. Even ""all-natural"" or herbal cigarettes have harmful chemicals.
People who smoke cigarettes are much more likely to develop and die of certain diseases than are people who don't smoke. But smoking can cause many different health issues, including:
Lung cancer and lung disease.Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer deaths in countries such as the United States. Smoking also causes lung diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Smoking makes asthma worse too.
Other cancers.Smoking raises the risk of many types of cancer. Some examples include cancer of the mouth, throat, also called the pharynx, esophagus, larynx, bladder, pancreas, kidney and cervix and some types of leukemia. Overall, smoking causes 30% of all cancer deaths in the United States.
Heart and blood vessel conditions.Smoking raises the risk of dying of heart and blood vessel diseases including heart attack and stroke. If you have a heart or blood vessel disease, smoking makes it worse.
Diabetes.Smoking raises the risk of type 2 diabetes. If you have diabetes, smoking can lead to other health concerns such as kidney disease and eye conditions.
Eye conditions.Smoking can raise the risk of serious eye issues such as cataracts and loss of eyesight from macular degeneration.
Infertility.Smoking can make it harder to start a pregnancy.
Complications during pregnancy.Pregnant people who smoke have a higher risk of miscarriages and preterm deliveries. Their babies have a higher risk of having medical conditions present at birth and lower birth weights.
Cold, flu and other illnesses.People who smoke are more prone to respiratory infections such as colds, the flu and bronchitis.
Tooth and gum disease.Smoking is linked to a higher risk of gum disease and tooth loss.
Smoking also poses health risks to those around you. Partners of people who smoke have a higher risk of lung cancer and heart disease compared with people who don't live with someone who smokes. Children whose parents smoke are more likely to get bronchitis, pneumonia, ear infections and colds. And if a child has asthma, secondhand smoke can make it worse.","The best way to prevent nicotine dependence is to not start using tobacco.
The best way to keep children from smoking is to not smoke yourself. Children whose parents do not smoke or who successfully quit smoking are much less likely to take up smoking.","Your healthcare professional may ask you questions or have you fill out a questionnaire to see how dependent you are on nicotine. Knowing your degree of dependence helps your healthcare professional figure out the right treatment plan for you. The more cigarettes you smoke each day and the sooner you smoke after waking up, the more dependent you are.","Like most people who smoke, you've probably made at least one serious attempt to stop. But it's rare to stop smoking on your first attempt — especially if you try to do it without help. You're much more likely to be able to stop smoking if you use medicines and counseling. Both of these treatments work, especially if you use them together.","Social support is key to leading a stable and solid smoke-free life. Ask your family, friends and co-workers to support and encourage you. Be direct and let them know what would help you most.
Also think about trying these resources:
Support groups.Support groups offer coaching and support from others trying to quit. You can often attend at little or no cost. For example, in the United States, Nicotine Anonymous groups can be found in many locations.
Telephone counseling.Quit lines offer convenient access to trained counselors. In the U.S., call800-QUIT-NOW(800-784-8669) to connect directly to your state's quit line.
Text messaging and mobile apps.Services can send reminders and tips to your mobile phone.
Web-based programs.Sites such as BecomeAnEX provide free personalized support, interactive guides and tools, and discussion groups to help you quit.","You're likely to start by seeing your primary healthcare professional.

Mesenteric lymphadenitis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mesenteric-lymphadenitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353799,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mesenteric-lymphadenitis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353803,,"Lymphadenitis is a condition in which the small round or bean-shaped clusters of cells, called lymph nodes, become swollen and inflamed. The swelling can affect the lymph nodes in the membrane that connects the bowel to the wall around the stomach area, called the mesentery. Then the condition is called mesenteric lymphadenitis (mez-un-TER-ik lim-fad-uh-NIE-tis).
An infection in the intestines, such as a virus, is the usual cause of mesenteric lymphadenitis. Also called mesenteric adenitis, the condition mainly affects children and teens.
Mesenteric lymphadenitis can act like appendicitis or a condition in which part of the intestine slides into another part of the intestine, called intussusception. Unlike appendicitis or intussusception, mesenteric lymphadenitis usually clears up on its own.","Possible symptoms of mesenteric lymphadenitis include:
Pain in the stomach area, often on the lower right side, but the pain can be more spread out.
General tenderness of the stomach area.
Fever.
Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes.
Depending on what's causing the condition, symptoms also might include:
Diarrhea.
Nausea and vomiting.","Pain in the stomach area is common in children and teens. So it can be hard to know when to seek medical advice.
Call a healthcare professional right away for a child who has:
Sudden, severe pain in the stomach area.
Stomach area pain with fever.
Stomach area pain with diarrhea or vomiting.
Tenderness to touch of the stomach area.
Bloody or maroon-colored stool.
Also, call a healthcare provider for a child who has pain in the stomach area that doesn't get better in a short time and who also:
Has a change in bowel habits.
Has a loss of appetite.
Is not able to sleep.","The most common cause of mesenteric lymphadenitis is a viral infection, such as gastroenteritis. Gastroenteritis is often called stomach flu. This infection causes inflammation and swelling in the lymph nodes in the thin tissue that attaches the intestine to the back of the wall around the stomach area, called mesentery.
Other causes of mesenteric lymphadenitis include bacterial infection, inflammatory bowel disease and lymphoma.","Any infection that causes inflammation and swelling in the lymph nodes in the tissue that attaches the bowel to the abdominal wall increases the risk of mesenteric lymphadenitis.
Conditions that raise the risk of mesenteric lymphadenitis include:
Viral or bacterial gastroenteritis.
Inflammatory bowel disease.
Lymphoma.",,,"Diagnosing mesenteric lymphadenitis involves taking a medical history and doing an exam. Tests might include:
Blood tests.Certain blood tests can help show if there's an infection and what type of infection it is.
Imaging studies.An ultrasound of the stomach area is often used to diagnose mesenteric lymphadenitis. ACTscan of the stomach area also might be used.","Mild cases of mesenteric lymphadenitis and those caused by a virus usually go away on their own. Full recovery can take four weeks or more.
For treatment of fever or pain, consider giving your child infants' or children's over-the-counter fever and pain medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others). They're safer than aspirin.
Use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Though aspirin is approved for use in children older than age 3, children and teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin. This is because aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, in such children.
Antibiotics might be prescribed for a moderate to severe bacterial infection.",,"If your child has symptoms of mesenteric lymphadenitis, make an appointment with a healthcare professional. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.","For symptoms of mesenteric lymphadenitis, have your child:
Get plenty of rest.Enough rest can help your child recover.
Drink fluids.Liquids help prevent loss of body fluids, called dehydration, from fever, vomiting and diarrhea.
Apply moist heat.A warm, moist washcloth applied to the stomach area can help ease discomfort.
Eat a liquid diet in small amounts.For example, eat broth or chicken noodle soup."

It often continues into adulthood. ADHD includes a mix of ongoing problems. These can include having a hard time paying attention, being hyperactive and being impulsive.
Children with ADHD also may have low self-esteem and troubled relationships and do poorly in school. Symptoms sometimes lessen with age. Some people never completely outgrow their ADHD symptoms but they can learn strategies to be successful.
While treatment won't cure ADHD, it can help a great deal with symptoms. Besides giving education about ADHD, treatment can involve medicines and behavior therapies. Early diagnosis and treatment can make a big difference in results.","The main features of ADHD include not paying attention and being hyperactive and impulsive. ADHD symptoms usually start before age 12. In some children, they can be seen as early as 3 years of age. ADHD symptoms can be mild, moderate or severe. Symptoms need to be seen in two or more settings, such as at home and at school. The symptoms cause problems with development and daily life and may continue into adulthood.
ADHD occurs more often in boys than in girls. Behaviors can be different in boys and girls. For example, boys may be more hyperactive and girls may tend to quietly not pay attention.
There are three types of ADHD:
Predominately inattentive.In this type, most symptoms fall under inattention. This means having trouble focusing and staying on a task. It also includes trouble getting and staying organized.
Predominately hyperactive and impulsive.In this type, most symptoms involve being hyperactive and impulsive. Hyperactive means being too active and having too much energy. It may include disruptive behavior. Being impulsive means acting without thinking ahead about the results or effects of behavior.
Combined.This type is a mix of inattentive symptoms and hyperactive and impulsive symptoms. The person meets the criteria for both predominately inattentive and predominately hyperactive and impulsive types of ADHD.","If you're concerned that your child shows signs of ADHD, see your pediatrician or family healthcare professional. Your healthcare professional can do a medical evaluation to check for other causes of your child's symptoms. Then if needed, your child may be referred to a specialist, such as a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, psychologist, psychiatrist or pediatric neurologist.","While the exact cause of ADHD is not clear, research efforts continue. Factors that may be involved in the development of ADHD include genetics, the environment or central nervous system conditions at key moments in development.","Risk factors for ADHD may include:
Having a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with ADHD or another mental health condition.
Being around environmental toxins such as lead, which is found mainly in paint and pipes in older buildings.
Being born to a parent who used recreational drugs, alcohol or tobacco during pregnancy.
Being born too early, also called premature birth.
Although many people seem to believe that sugar causes hyperactivity, there's no proof of this. Many issues in childhood can lead to trouble paying attention, but that's not the same as ADHD.","ADHD can make life hard for children. Children with ADHD:
Often have trouble in the classroom, which can lead to failing grades and being judged by other children and adults.
Tend to have more accidents and injuries of all kinds than do children who don't have ADHD.
Tend to have poor self-esteem.
Are more likely to have trouble interacting with and being accepted by peers and adults.
Are at higher risk of alcohol and drug misuse and other behavior that can cause problems with the law.
Have a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and suicide.
Have sleep disorders.","To help lower your child's risk of ADHD:
During pregnancy,avoid anything that could harm your baby's development before birth. For example, don't drink alcohol, use drugs or smoke cigarettes.
Protect your child from exposure to pollutants and toxins,including cigarette smoke and lead paint.
Limit screen time.Although still not proved, it may be a good idea for young children to limit TV, video games and other screen time.","In general, a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is made if the core symptoms of ADHD start early in life — before age 12 — and create major problems at home and at school on an ongoing basis.
There's no specific test for ADHD. An evaluation can help find out whether symptoms are related to ADHD or another problem. Making a diagnosis will likely include:
A medical exam.This can help rule out other possible causes of symptoms.
Information gathering.This includes reviewing any current medical conditions, personal and family medical history, and school records.
Interviews or surveys.These may include information from family members, teachers or other people who know your child well, such as caregivers, babysitters and coaches. This information can show how your child behaves in different situations.
ADHD rating scales.These help collect and evaluate information about your child.","Standard treatments for ADHD in children include medicines, behavior therapy, counseling and education services. These treatments can lessen many of the symptoms of ADHD, but they don't cure it. Treatment also can help prevent some complications caused by ADHD. It may take some time to find what works best for your child.","Caring for a child with ADHD can be challenging for the whole family. Caregivers may be distressed by their child's behavior as well as by the way other people respond. The stress of dealing with ADHD can lead to conflict in a marriage or partnership. These problems can be made worse by the financial burden that ADHD can place on families.
Siblings of a child with ADHD also may have a hard time. They can be affected by a sibling who is demanding or aggressive. They also may get less attention because the child with ADHD requires so much of a parent's time.","You're likely to start by taking your child to a pediatrician or family healthcare professional. Depending on the results of the evaluation, your healthcare professional may refer you to a specialist, such as a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, psychologist, psychiatrist or pediatric neurologist.","Because ADHD is complex and each person with ADHD is different, it's hard to make recommendations that work for every child.

Signs and symptoms typically begin slowly, then get worse. Over time, symptoms get better, usually within 1 to 3 years.
Having to keep a shoulder still for a long period increases the risk of developing frozen shoulder. This might happen after having surgery or breaking an arm.
Treatment for frozen shoulder involves range-of-motion exercises. Sometimes treatment involves corticosteroids and numbing medications injected into the joint. Rarely, arthroscopic surgery is needed to loosen the joint capsule so that it can move more freely.
It's unusual for frozen shoulder to recur in the same shoulder. But some people can develop it in the other shoulder, usually within five years.","Frozen shoulder typically develops slowly in three stages.
Freezing stage.Any movement of the shoulder causes pain, and the shoulder's ability to move becomes limited. This stage lasts from 2 to 9 months.
Frozen stage.Pain might lessen during this stage. However, the shoulder becomes stiffer. Using it becomes more difficult. This stage lasts from 4 to 12 months.
Thawing stage.The shoulder's ability to move begins to improve. This stage lasts from 5 to 24 months.
For some people, the pain worsens at night, sometimes disrupting sleep.",,"The shoulder joint is enclosed in a capsule of connective tissue. Frozen shoulder occurs when this capsule thickens and tightens around the shoulder joint, restricting its movement.
It's unclear why this happens to some people. But it's more likely to happen after keeping a shoulder still for a long period, such as after surgery or an arm fracture.",Certain factors may increase the risk of developing frozen shoulder.,,"One of the most common causes of frozen shoulder is not moving a shoulder while recovering from a shoulder injury, broken arm or stroke. If you've had an injury that makes it difficult to move your shoulder, talk to your health care provider about exercises that can help you maintain your ability to move your shoulder joint.","During the physical exam, a health care provider might ask you to move your arm in certain ways. This is to check for pain and see how far you can move your arm (active range of motion). Then you might be asked to relax your muscles while the provider moves your arm (passive range of motion). Frozen shoulder affects both active and passive range of motion.
Frozen shoulder can usually be diagnosed from signs and symptoms alone. But imaging tests — such as X-rays, ultrasound or MRI — can rule out other problems.",Most frozen shoulder treatment involves controlling shoulder pain and preserving as much range of motion in the shoulder as possible.,,"You might first see your primary care provider. In some cases, you may be referred to a doctor who specializes in treating bones and muscles (orthopedist or physiatrist).",Continue to use the shoulder and arm as much as possible given your pain and range-of-motion limits. Applying heat or cold to your shoulder can help relieve pain.
Childhood schizophrenia,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/childhood-schizophrenia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354483,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/childhood-schizophrenia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354489,,"Childhood schizophrenia is an uncommon but severe mental disorder in which children and teenagers interpret reality abnormally. Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognitive), behavior or emotions. It may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior that impairs your child's ability to function.
Childhood schizophrenia is essentially the same as schizophrenia in adults, but it starts early in life — generally in the teenage years — and has a profound impact on a child's behavior and development. With childhood schizophrenia, the early age of onset presents special challenges for diagnosis, treatment, education, and emotional and social development.
Schizophrenia is a chronic condition that requires lifelong treatment. Identifying and starting treatment for childhood schizophrenia as early as possible may significantly improve your child's long-term outcome.","Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking, behavior or emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. The effect can be disabling.
In most people with schizophrenia, symptoms generally start in the mid- to late 20s, though it can start later, up to the mid-30s. Schizophrenia is considered early onset when it starts before the age of 18. Onset of schizophrenia in children younger than age 13 is extremely rare.
Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present. Schizophrenia can be difficult to recognize in the early phases.","It can be difficult to know how to handle vague behavioral changes in your child. You may be afraid of rushing to conclusions that label your child with a mental illness. Your child's teacher or other school staff may alert you to changes in your child's behavior.
Seek medical care as soon as possible if you have concerns about your child's behavior or development.","It's not known what causes childhood schizophrenia, but it's thought that it develops in the same way as adult schizophrenia does. Researchers believe that a combination of genetics, brain chemistry and environment contributes to development of the disorder. It's not clear why schizophrenia starts so early in life for some and not for others.
Problems with certain naturally occurring brain chemicals, including neurotransmitters called dopamine and glutamate, may contribute to schizophrenia. Neuroimaging studies show differences in the brain structure and central nervous system of people with schizophrenia. While researchers aren't certain about the significance of these changes, they indicate that schizophrenia is a brain disease.","Although the precise cause of schizophrenia isn't known, certain factors seem to increase the risk of developing or triggering schizophrenia, including:
Having a family history of schizophrenia
Increased immune system activation, such as from inflammation
Older age of the father
Some pregnancy and birth complications, such as malnutrition or exposure to toxins or viruses that may impact brain development
Taking mind-altering (psychoactive) drugs during teen years","Left untreated, childhood schizophrenia can result in severe emotional, behavioral and health problems. Complications associated with schizophrenia may occur in childhood or later, such as:
Suicide, suicide attempts and thoughts of suicide
Self-injury
Anxiety disorders, panic disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
Depression
Abuse of alcohol or other drugs, including nicotine
Family conflicts
Inability to live independently, attend school or work
Social isolation
Health and medical problems
Being victimized
Legal and financial problems, and homelessness
Aggressive behavior, although uncommon","Early identification and treatment may help get symptoms of childhood schizophrenia under control before serious complications develop. Early treatment is also crucial in helping limit psychotic episodes, which can be extremely frightening to a child and his or her parents. Ongoing treatment can help improve your child's long-term outlook.","Diagnosis of childhood schizophrenia involves ruling out other mental health disorders and determining that symptoms aren't due to alcohol or drug use, medication or a medical condition. The process of diagnosis may involve:
Physical exam.This may be done to help rule out other problems that could be causing symptoms and to check for any related complications.
Tests and screenings.These may include tests that help rule out conditions with similar symptoms, and screening for alcohol and drugs. The doctor may also request imaging studies, such as an MRI or CT scan.
Psychiatric evaluation.This includes observing appearance and demeanor, asking about thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns, including any thoughts of self-harm or harming others, evaluating ability to think and function at an age-appropriate level, and assessing mood, anxiety and possible psychotic symptoms. This also includes a discussion of family and personal history.
Diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia.Your doctor or mental health professional may use the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association.","Schizophrenia in children requires lifelong treatment, even during periods when symptoms seem to go away. Treatment is a particular challenge for children with schizophrenia.","Coping with childhood schizophrenia can be challenging. Medications can have unwanted side effects, and you, your child and your whole family may feel angry or resentful about having to manage a condition that requires lifelong treatment. To help cope with childhood schizophrenia:
Learn about the condition.Education about schizophrenia can empower you and your child and motivate him or her to stick to the treatment plan. Education can help friends and family understand the condition and be more compassionate with your child.
Join a support group.Support groups for people with schizophrenia can help you reach out to other families facing similar challenges. You may want to seek out separate groups for you and for your child so that you each have a safe outlet.
Get professional help.If you as a parent or guardian feel overwhelmed and distressed by your child's condition, consider seeking help for yourself from a mental health professional.
Stay focused on goals.Dealing with childhood schizophrenia is an ongoing process. Stay motivated as a family by keeping treatment goals in mind.
Find healthy outlets.Explore healthy ways your whole family can channel energy or frustration, such as hobbies, exercise and recreational activities.
Make healthy lifestyle choices.Maintaining a regular schedule that includes sufficient sleep, healthy eating and regular physical activity is important to mental health.
Take time as individuals.Although managing childhood schizophrenia is a family affair, both children and parents need their own time to cope and unwind. Create opportunities for healthy alone time.
Begin future planning.Ask about social service assistance. Most individuals with schizophrenia require some form of daily living support. Many communities have programs to help people with schizophrenia with jobs, affordable housing, transportation, self-help groups, other daily activities and crisis situations. A case manager or someone on the treatment team can help find resources.","You're likely to start by first having your child see his or her pediatrician or family doctor. In some cases, you may be referred immediately to a specialist, such as a pediatric psychiatrist or other mental health professional who's an expert in schizophrenia.
In rare cases where safety is an issue, your child may require an emergency evaluation in the emergency room and possibly admission for psychiatric care in a hospital.","Although childhood schizophrenia requires professional treatment, it's critical to be an active participant in your child's care. Here are ways to get the most out of the treatment plan.
Follow directions for medications.Try to make sure that your child takes medications as prescribed, even if he or she is feeling well and has no current symptoms. If medications are stopped or taken infrequently, the symptoms are likely to come back and your doctor will have a hard time knowing what the best and safest dose is.
Check first before taking other medications.Contact the doctor who's treating your child for schizophrenia before your child takes medications prescribed by another doctor or before taking any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, minerals, herbs or other supplements. These can interact with schizophrenia medications.
Pay attention to warning signs.You and your child may have identified things that may trigger symptoms, cause a relapse or prevent your child from carrying out daily activities. Make a plan so that you know what to do if symptoms return. Contact your child's doctor or therapist if you notice any changes in symptoms, to prevent the situation from worsening.
Make physical activity and healthy eating a priority.Some medications for schizophrenia are associated with an increased risk of weight gain and high cholesterol in children. Work with your child's doctor to make a nutrition and physical activity plan for your child that will help manage weight and benefit heart health.
Avoid alcohol, recreational drugs and nicotine.Alcohol, recreational drugs and nicotine can worsen schizophrenia symptoms or interfere with antipsychotic medications. Talk to your child about avoiding drugs and alcohol and not smoking. If necessary, get appropriate treatment for a substance use problem."
Benign adrenal tumors,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/benign-adrenal-tumors/symptoms-causes/syc-20356190,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/benign-adrenal-tumors/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20567035,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/benign-adrenal-tumors/doctors-departments/ddc-20356192,"Benign adrenal tumors are masses that aren't cancer. They form in the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are part of the endocrine system. These glands make hormones that send messages to nearly every organ and tissue in the body.
There are two adrenal glands, one above each kidney. Each gland has two types of tissue: the cortex and the medulla. Benign adrenal tumors that grow in the cortex are called adrenal adenomas. Those that grow in the medulla are called pheochromocytomas (fee-o-kroe-moe-sy-TOE-muhs).
Most benign adrenal tumors cause no symptoms and don't need treatment. But sometimes these tumors make high levels of some hormones that can cause problems. Hormones from the cortex control metabolism, blood pressure and certain body features, such as hair growth. Hormones from the medulla control the body's response to stress.","Symptoms depend on whether the tumor makes hormones, what hormone it makes and how much it makes. But many benign adrenal gland tumors don't cause symptoms because they don't make hormones.
The most common type of benign adrenal tumor, called adenoma, comes from the adrenal cortex. This type of tumor might cause symptoms such as:
Weight gain.
Easy bruising.
High blood pressure, also called hypertension.
Diabetes.
Depressed mood.
Tiredness.
Muscle weakness or cramping.
A type of benign adrenal tumor from the medulla is called pheochromocytoma. It might cause the following symptoms:
High blood pressure, also called hypertension.
Fast heartbeat.
Sweating.
Tremors.
Headache.",,The cause of benign adrenal tumors often is not known.,"The following might raise the risk of developing a benign adrenal tumor:
A family history of benign adrenal tumors.
Certain syndromes passed through families, called genetic syndromes, that make benign adrenal tumors more likely.
A history of having an adrenal tumor surgically removed.",,,Benign adrenal tumors often are found by chance on imaging that's done for another reason. A healthcare professional then looks at how likely the tumor is to be cancer and whether it's making too much hormone.,"Benign adrenal tumors often don't need treatment. Treatment depends on how likely the tumor is to become cancer. Treatment also might depend on whether the tumor is making hormones, the type of hormone it makes and how much it's making.
Treatment for small benign adrenal tumors that aren't making hormones might involve watching the tumor. There might be repeat imaging tests 3 to 6 months after diagnosis, and then every one or two years. Watching also might involve testing hormones every year for five years.
If the tumor is getting bigger or causing symptoms, the symptoms might be treated with medicines. Medicines also might be used to treat symptoms such as high blood pressure before surgery.
Surgery to remove the adrenal gland, called adrenalectomy, might be used to treat a benign adrenal tumor. The surgery may be done laparoscopically if the tumor is small and not likely to be cancer.",,"You might start by seeing your primary healthcare professional. Or you might be sent to a specialist in the endocrine system, called an endocrinologist.

Autoimmune encephalitis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autoimmune-encephalitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20576380,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autoimmune-encephalitis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20576406,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autoimmune-encephalitis/doctors-departments/ddc-20576425,"Autoimmune encephalitis (en-sef-uh-LIE-tis) is a group of conditions that causes swelling in the brain. This happens because the immune system mistakenly attacks brain cells. Autoimmune encephalitis symptoms can vary but may include memory loss, changes in thinking, changes in behavior and seizures.
Autoimmune encephalitis is different from encephalitis caused by viral or bacterial infections, known as infectious encephalitis. Infectious encephalitis isn't caused by an immune reaction, and it's treated with different medicines. Research has found that the number of people with autoimmune encephalitis is comparable to the number of people with infectious encephalitis.
Experts don't know what causes autoimmune encephalitis, also known as AE. For some people, AE is triggered by certain cancers or infections. Autoimmune encephalitis also may be triggered by medicines. People with an autoimmune disease or a family history of autoimmune disease may be more likely to get AE. Healthcare professionals use several tests to diagnose autoimmune encephalitis.
Without treatment, autoimmune encephalitis can cause serious complications, including death. But treatments can lead to recovery. Many people with AE make a full recovery, but some can have lasting symptoms.","Autoimmune encephalitis symptoms can vary from person to person. But symptoms can occur in a pattern that is predictable depending on the type of autoimmune encephalitis. Many people have a headache, fever and other symptoms of an infection followed by:
Psychiatric symptoms that may include anxiety, panic attacks, changes in behavior, agitation, hallucinations, delusions and trouble organizing thoughts.
Trouble with memory.
Trouble with language, such as talking less or repeating words or phrases.
Movements that are not voluntary.
Seizures.
Changes in consciousness.
Less sleep at the beginning of the disease followed by excess sleep during recovery.
Sometimes AE causes serious seizures that need emergency care, known as status epilepticus. These seizures last more than five minutes or occur one after another while the person is not conscious.
Autoimmune encephalitis symptoms can get worse over time. This disease course is known as progressive. Symptoms also might alternate between getting better and getting worse. This course is known as relapsing-remitting. These are similar to the disease courses people experience with multiple sclerosis.","Get emergency medical care if you or someone you're with has serious symptoms of AE. This includes having seizures that last more than five minutes or that happen one after another with a loss of consciousness. Also seek emergency medical care for high fevers or trouble breathing.
See your healthcare professional right away if you have any other symptoms of autoimmune encephalitis. AE can become serious quickly if not treated.","Autoimmune encephalitis causes are not known. Autoimmune encephalitis, also known as AE, happens when the immune system mistakenly attacks heathy brain cells.
Antibodies are part of the immune system. They help protect the body from viruses, bacteria and other substances that can cause illnesses. But in autoimmune encephalitis, the antibodies target and attack certain receptors in the brain. This leads to swelling in the brain, also known as inflammation, and other symptoms.
AE may be triggered by:
Certain cancers. When this happens, it's known as paraneoplastic AE.
Infections, such as from the herpes simplex virus.
Certain medicines, such as monoclonal antibodies and medicines to suppress the immune system after a transplant.
Autoimmune encephalitis is more likely to occur in people who have an autoimmune disease or who have a strong family history of autoimmune disease.","Risk factors for autoimmune encephalitis, also known as AE, include:
Having had AE in the past, especially if it wasn't treated.
Having had herpes simplex virus encephalitis.
Taking monoclonal antibodies or medicines to suppress the immune system after a transplant.
Having a tumor, especially small-cell lung cancer.
Researchers are studying whether certain genes may be related to autoimmune encephalitis.","Serious autoimmune encephalitis, also known as AE, can lead to complications such as:
Seizures that need emergency care, known as status epilepticus.The immune system's attack on the brain during AE can lead to seizures and a condition called autoimmune epilepsy. Sometimes the seizures may last more than five minutes or occur one after another. The person isn't conscious in between the seizures. These serious seizures are known as status epilepticus.
Not enough air entering the lungs, known as respiratory failure.People with respiratory failure may need treatment with a machine that helps them breathe, known as mechanical ventilation.
Trouble with heart rate and blood pressure.AE can affect heart rate, blood pressure, digestion and urination. These are known as autonomic functions.
Fevers.People with AE may have high fevers.
Another possible complication is that the condition may come back after recovery. This is known as a relapse. A relapse is more likely in people who had anti-LGI1 limbic encephalitis or anti-CASPR2 associated encephalitis.","Autoimmune encephalitis, also known as AE, can't always be prevented. But getting cancer screenings can help your healthcare professional find tumors and treat them early. This could prevent autoimmune encephalitis that is triggered by cancers. Talk with your healthcare professional about your cancer risk and if cancer screening is recommended.","Autoimmune encephalitis diagnosis involves a review of your symptoms, a physical exam and several tests. It's important to get an accurate diagnosis because autoimmune encephalitis, also known as AE, can be mistaken for other diseases.
Experts have created autoimmune encephalitis criteria to help healthcare professionals diagnose people with AE. Healthcare professionals look for patterns of symptoms that signal AE. They also test for signs that antibodies are attacking receptors in the brain to cause AE.
Tests also help rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, such as infections or other autoimmune conditions.
Sometimes people are incorrectly diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis. It's important for healthcare professionals to consider all potential conditions when making a diagnosis.","Autoimmune encephalitis treatment focuses on the immune system, which is mistakenly attacking brain cells. If a tumor is causing autoimmune encephalitis, the first step is to diagnose and treat the tumor.",,"Autoimmune encephalitis can cause serious symptoms that need emergency medical care. Your healthcare team includes specialists, including doctors who specialize in the brain and nervous system, known as neurologists.

It can cause sudden weakness in the arms or legs, loss of muscle tone, and loss of reflexes. The condition mainly affects young children.

Most children have a mild respiratory illness or fever caused by a viral infection about one to four weeks before developing symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis.

If you or your child develops symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis, seek immediate medical care. Symptoms can progress rapidly. Hospitalization is needed and sometimes a ventilator is required for breathing support.

Since experts began tracking acute flaccid myelitis following initial clusters in 2014, outbreaks in the United States have occurred in 2016 and 2018. Outbreaks tend to occur between August and November.","The most common signs and symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis include:

Other possible signs and symptoms include:

Uncommon symptoms might include:

Severe symptoms involve respiratory failure, due to the muscles involved in breathing becoming weak. It's also possible to experience life-threatening body temperature changes and blood pressure instability.","If you or your child has any of the signs or symptoms listed above, seek medical care as soon as possible.","Acute flaccid myelitis might be caused by an infection with a type of virus known as an enterovirus. Respiratory illnesses and fever from enteroviruses are common — especially in children. Most people recover. It's not clear why some people with an enterovirus infection develop acute flaccid myelitis.

In the United States many viruses, including enteroviruses, circulate between August and November. This is when acute flaccid myelitis outbreaks tend to occur.

The symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis can look similar to those of the viral disease polio. But none of the acute flaccid myelitis cases in the United States have been caused by poliovirus.",Acute flaccid myelitis mainly affects young children.,Muscle weakness caused by acute flaccid myelitis can continue for months to years.,"There's no specific way to prevent acute flaccid myelitis. However, preventing a viral infection can help reduce the risk of developing acute flaccid myelitis.

Take these steps to help protect yourself or your child from getting or spreading a viral infection:","To diagnose acute flaccid myelitis, the doctor starts with a thorough medical history and physical exam. The doctor might recommend:

Acute flaccid myelitis can be hard to diagnose because it shares many of the same symptoms as other neurological diseases, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome. These tests can help distinguish acute flaccid myelitis from other conditions.","Currently, there is no specific treatment for acute flaccid myelitis. Treatment is aimed at managing symptoms.

A doctor who specializes in treating brain and spinal cord illnesses (neurologist) might recommend physical or occupational therapy to help with arm or leg weakness. If physical therapy is started during the initial phase of the illness, it might improve long-term recovery.

The doctor might also recommend treatment with immunoglobulin that contains healthy antibodies from healthy donors, drugs that lower inflammation in the body (corticosteroids) or antiviral drugs. Or the doctor might recommend a treatment that removes and replaces blood plasma (plasma exchange). However, it's not clear whether these treatments have any benefits.

Sometimes nerve and muscle transfer surgeries are done to improve limb function.",,"If you have symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis, seek immediate medical care.

Dry macular degeneration,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dry-macular-degeneration/symptoms-causes/syc-20350375,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dry-macular-degeneration/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350381,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dry-macular-degeneration/doctors-departments/ddc-20350384,"Dry macular degeneration is an eye condition that causes blurred vision or reduced central vision. It is caused by the breakdown of a part of the retina known as the macula (MAK-u-luh). The macula is responsible for central vision. This condition is common among people over 50.
Dry macular degeneration may start in one eye then develop in the other eye. It also may develop in both eyes at the same time. Over time, vision may worsen and affect the ability to do things, such as read, drive and recognize faces. But having dry macular degeneration doesn't mean you'll lose all your sight. Vision loss is typically central, and people retain their side vision. Some people have only mild central vision loss. In others, it can be more severe.
Early detection and self-care measures may delay vision loss caused by dry macular degeneration.","Dry macular degeneration symptoms usually develop gradually and without pain. They may include:
Visual distortions, such as straight lines seeming bent.
Reduced central vision in one or both eyes.
The need for brighter light when reading or doing close-up work.
Increased difficulty adapting to low light levels, such as when entering a dimly lit restaurant or theater.
Increased blurriness of printed words.
Difficulty recognizing faces.
A well-defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision.
Dry macular degeneration can affect one or both eyes. If only one eye is affected, you may not notice any changes in your vision. This is because your good eye may compensate for the affected eye. And the condition doesn't affect the side vision, so it does not cause total blindness.
Dry macular degeneration is one of two types of age-related macular degeneration. It can progress to wet macular degeneration, which is when blood vessels grow and leak under the retina. The dry type is more common, but it usually progresses slowly over years. The wet type is more likely to cause a relatively sudden change in vision resulting in serious vision loss.","See your eye care professional if:
You notice changes, such as distortion or blind spots, in your central vision.
You lose the ability to see fine detail.
These changes may be the first sign of macular degeneration, particularly if you're over age 60.","No one knows exactly what causes dry macular degeneration. Research suggests that it may be a combination of genes and other factors, including smoking, obesity and diet.
The condition develops as the eye ages. Dry macular degeneration affects the macula. The macula is the area of the retina that's responsible for clear vision in the direct line of sight. Over time, tissue in the macula may thin and lose cells responsible for vision.","Factors that may increase the risk of macular degeneration include:
Age.This disease is most common in people over 50.
Family history and genetics.This disease has a hereditary component, meaning it runs in families. Researchers have identified several genes linked to the condition.
Race.Macular degeneration is more common in white people.
Smoking.Smoking cigarettes or being exposed to tobacco smoke on a regular basis greatly increases the risk of macular degeneration.
Obesity.Research suggests that obesity may increase the chance that early or intermediate macular degeneration will progress to the more serious form of the disease.
Cardiovascular disease.If you have heart or blood vessel disease, called cardiovascular disease, you may be at higher risk of macular degeneration.","People whose dry macular degeneration has progressed to central vision loss have a higher risk of depression and social isolation. With profound loss of vision, people may see visual hallucinations. This condition is called Charles Bonnet syndrome. Dry macular degeneration may progress to wet macular degeneration, which can quickly cause complete vision loss if left untreated.","It's important to have routine eye exams to identify early signs of macular degeneration. The following measures may help reduce the risk of developing dry macular degeneration:
Manage all medical conditions.For example, if you have cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure, take your medicine and follow your healthcare team's instructions for controlling the condition.
Don't smoke.People who smoke are more likely to develop macular degeneration than are people who don't smoke. Ask a healthcare professional for help stopping smoking.
Maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly.If you need to lose weight, reduce the number of calories you eat and increase the amount of exercise you get each day.
Choose a diet rich in fruits and vegetables.These foods contain antioxidant vitamins that reduce your risk of developing macular degeneration.
Include fish in your diet.Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, may reduce the risk of macular degeneration. Nuts such as walnuts also contain omega-3 fatty acids.","An eye care professional may diagnose dry macular degeneration by reviewing medical and family history and doing a complete eye exam. Other tests may be done, including:
Examination of the back of the eye.An eye doctor puts drops in the eyes to dilate them and uses a special tool to examine the back of the eye. The eye doctor looks for a mottled appearance that's caused by yellow deposits that form under the retina, called drusen. People with macular degeneration often have many drusen.
A test for changes in the center of the vision field.An Amsler grid may be used to test for changes in the center of the vision field. If you have macular degeneration, some of the straight lines in the grid may look faded, broken or distorted.
Fluorescein angiography.During this test, an eye doctor injects a dye into a vein in the arm. The dye travels to and highlights the blood vessels in the eye. A special camera takes pictures as the dye travels through the blood vessels. The images may show retinal or blood vessel changes.
Indocyanine green angiography.Like fluorescein angiography, this test uses an injected dye. It may be used alongside a fluorescein angiogram to identify specific types of macular degeneration.
Optical coherence tomography.This noninvasive imaging test displays detailed cross sections of the retina. It identifies areas of thinning, thickening or swelling. These can be caused by fluid buildup from leaking blood vessels in and under the retina.","For now, there's no way to reverse damage from dry macular degeneration. However, there are many clinical trials in progress. If the condition is diagnosed early, you can take steps to help slow its progression, such as taking vitamin supplements, eating healthy and not smoking.","These tips may help you cope with your changing vision:
Get your eyeglass prescription checked.If you wear contacts or glasses, be sure your prescription is up to date. If new glasses don't help, ask for a referral to a low vision specialist.
Use magnifiers.A variety of magnifying devices can help you with reading and other close-up work, such as sewing. Such devices include hand-held magnifying lenses or magnifying lenses you wear like glasses.You also may use a closed-circuit television system that uses a video camera to magnify reading material and project it on a video screen.
Change your computer display and add audio systems.Adjust the font size in your computer's settings. And adjust your monitor to show more contrast. You also may add speech-output systems or other technologies to your computer.
Use electronic reading aids and voice interfaces.Try large-print books, tablet computers and audiobooks. Some tablet and smartphone apps are designed to help people with low vision. And many of these devices now come with voice recognition features.
Select special appliances made for low vision.Some clocks, radios, telephones and other appliances have extra-large numbers. You may find it easier to watch a television with a larger high-definition screen, or you may want to sit closer to the screen.
Use brighter lights in your home.Better lighting helps with reading and other daily activities, and it may reduce the risk of falling.
Consider your transportation options.If you drive, check with your doctor to see if it's safe to continue doing so. Be extra cautious in certain situations, such as driving at night, in heavy traffic or in bad weather. Use public transportation or ask family members to help, especially with night driving. Or use local van or shuttle services, volunteer driving networks, or ride-sharing.
Get support.Having macular degeneration can be difficult, and you may need to make changes in your life. You may go through many emotions as you adjust. Consider talking to a counselor or joining a support group. Spend time with supportive family members and friends.",You likely will need a dilated eye exam to check for macular degeneration. Make an appointment for a complete eye exam with a doctor who specializes in eye care — an optometrist or an ophthalmologist.,"Even after receiving a diagnosis of dry macular degeneration, these steps may help slow vision loss.
Don't smoke.If you smoke, ask a healthcare professional for help quitting.
Choose a healthy diet.The antioxidant vitamins in fruits and vegetables contribute to eye health. Kale, spinach, broccoli, squash and other vegetables have high levels of antioxidants, including lutein and zeaxanthin. These nutrients may benefit people with macular degeneration.Eating foods with high levels of zinc also may be helpful for people with macular degeneration. These include high-protein foods, such as beef, pork and lamb. Nonmeat sources include milk, cheese, yogurt, whole-grain cereals and whole-wheat bread.Another good choice is healthy unsaturated fat, such as in olive oil. And research studies have shown that a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as in salmon, tuna and walnuts, may lower the risk of advanced age-related macular degeneration. But the same benefit is not shown from taking omega-3 supplements, such as fish oil pills.
Manage your other medical conditions.If you have cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure, for example, take your medicine and follow your healthcare team's instructions for controlling the condition.
Maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly.If you need to lose weight, reduce the number of calories you eat and increase the amount of exercise you get each day.
Have routine eye exams.Ask your eye doctor about the recommended schedule for follow-up exams. In between checkups, you can do a self-assessment of your vision using an Amsler grid. These steps will help tell you if your condition develops into wet macular degeneration, which can be treated with medicines."

It is a type of age-related macular degeneration where blood vessels leak fluid or blood into part of the retina known as the macula (MAK-u-luh). The macula is responsible for central vision.
Wet macular degeneration is one of two types of age-related macular degeneration. The other type, dry macular degeneration, is more common and less severe. The wet type always begins as the dry type.
Early detection and treatment of wet macular degeneration may help reduce vision loss. In some instances, early treatment may recover vision.","Wet macular degeneration symptoms usually appear suddenly and worsen quickly. They may include:
Visual distortions, such as straight lines that seem to be bent.
Reduced central vision in one or both eyes.
The need for brighter light when reading or doing close-up work.
Difficulty adjusting to low light levels, such as when entering a dimly lit restaurant or theater.
Increased blurriness of printed words.
Difficulty recognizing faces.
A well-defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision.
Macular degeneration doesn't affect side vision, so it doesn't cause total blindness.","See your eye care professional if:
You notice changes in your central vision.
You lose the ability to see fine detail.
These changes may be the first sign of macular degeneration, particularly if you're older than age 60.","No one knows the exact cause of wet macular degeneration, but it develops in people who have dry macular degeneration. Of all people with age-related macular degeneration, about 20% have the wet form.
Wet macular degeneration can develop in different ways:
Vision loss caused by irregular blood vessel growth.Sometimes new blood vessels grow from the choroid under and into the macula. This growth isn't typical, and when it happens it's known as choroidal neovascularization. The choroid is the layer of blood vessels between the retina and the outer, firm coat of the eye, called the sclera. These blood vessels may leak fluid or blood, affecting the retina's function and leading to vision loss.
Vision loss caused by fluid buildup in the back of the eye.When fluid leaks from the choroid, it can collect between the thin cell layer called the retinal pigment epithelium and the retina or within the layers of the retina. This may cause irregularities in the macula layers, resulting in vision loss or distortion.","Factors that may increase the risk of macular degeneration include:
Age.This disease is most common in people over 50.
Family history and genetics.This disease has a hereditary component, meaning it can run in families. Researchers have identified several genes linked to the condition.
Race.Macular degeneration is more common in white people.
Smoking.Smoking cigarettes or being exposed to tobacco smoke on a regular basis greatly increases the risk of macular degeneration.
Obesity.Research suggests that obesity may increase the chance that early or intermediate macular degeneration will progress to a more severe form of the disease.
Cardiovascular disease.If you have diseases that affect your heart and blood vessels, you may be at higher risk of macular degeneration.","People whose wet macular degeneration has progressed to central vision loss have a higher risk of depression and social isolation. With profound loss of vision, people may see visual hallucinations. This condition is known as Charles Bonnet syndrome.","It's important to have routine eye exams to identify early signs of macular degeneration. The following measures may help reduce the risk of developing wet macular degeneration:
Manage all other medical conditions.For example, if you have cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure, take your medicine and follow your healthcare team's instructions for controlling the condition.
Don't smoke.People who smoke are more likely to develop macular degeneration than are people who don't smoke. Ask a healthcare professional for help stopping smoking.
Maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly.If you need to lose weight, reduce the number of calories you eat and increase the amount of exercise you get each day.
Choose a diet rich in fruits and vegetables.These foods contain antioxidant vitamins that reduce your risk of developing macular degeneration.
Include fish in your diet.Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, may reduce the risk of macular degeneration. Nuts such as walnuts also contain omega-3 fatty acids.","To diagnose wet macular degeneration, an eye doctor typically reviews medical and family history and does a complete eye exam. To confirm a diagnosis of macular degeneration, an eye doctor may suggest other tests, including:
Examination of the back of the eye.An eye doctor puts drops in the eyes to dilate them and uses a special tool to examine the back of the eye. The eye doctor looks for a mottled appearance that's caused by yellow deposits that form under the retina, called drusen. People with macular degeneration often have many drusen.
A test for changes in the center of the vision field.An Amsler grid may be used to test for changes in the center of the vision field. In macular degeneration, some of the straight lines in the grid may look faded, broken or distorted.
Fluorescein angiography.During this test, an eye doctor injects a dye into a vein in the arm. The dye travels to and highlights the blood vessels in the eye. A special camera takes pictures as the dye travels through the blood vessels. The images may show leaking blood vessels or retinal changes.
Indocyanine green angiography.Like fluorescein angiography, this test uses an injected dye. It may be used to confirm the findings of a fluorescein angiography or to identify problem blood vessels deeper in the retina.
Optical coherence tomography.This noninvasive imaging test displays detailed cross sections of the retina. It identifies areas of thinning, thickening or swelling. This test also is used to help monitor how the retina responds to macular degeneration treatments.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography.This noninvasive imaging test displays detailed cross sections of the retina. It identifies areas of thinning, thickening or swelling. These can be caused by fluid buildup from leaking blood vessels in and under the retina.","Treatments are available that may help slow disease progression and preserve existing vision. If started early enough, treatment may recover some lost vision.","Vision loss from macular degeneration can affect the ability to do things such as read, recognize faces and drive. These tips may help to cope with changing vision:
Get your eyeglass prescription checked.If you wear contacts or glasses, be sure your prescription is up to date. If new glasses don't help, ask for a referral to a low vision specialist.
Use magnifiers.A variety of magnifying devices can help you with reading and other close-up work, such as sewing. Such devices include hand-held magnifying lenses or magnifying lenses you wear like glasses.You also may use a closed-circuit television system that uses a video camera to magnify reading material and project it on a video screen.
Change your computer display and add audio systems.Adjust the font size in your computer's settings. And adjust your monitor to show more contrast. You also may add speech-output systems or other technologies to your computer.
Use electronic reading aids and voice interfaces.Try large-print books, tablet computers and audiobooks. Some tablet and smartphone apps are designed to help people with low vision. And many of these devices now come with voice recognition features.
Select special appliances made for low vision.Some clocks, radios, telephones and other appliances have extra-large numbers. You may find it easier to watch a television with a larger high-definition screen, or you may want to sit closer to the screen.
Use brighter lights in your home.Better lighting helps with reading and other daily activities, and it may reduce the risk of falling.
Consider your transportation options.If you drive, check with your doctor to see if it's safe to continue doing so. Be extra cautious in certain situations, such as driving at night, in heavy traffic or in bad weather. Use public transportation or ask a friend or family member to help, especially with night driving. Or use local van or shuttle services, volunteer driving networks, or ride-sharing.
Get support.Having macular degeneration can be difficult, and you may need to make changes in your life. You may go through many emotions as you adjust. Consider talking to a counselor or joining a support group. Spend time with supportive family members and friends.","You likely will need a dilated eye exam to check for macular degeneration. Make an appointment with a doctor who specializes in eye care, such as an optometrist or an ophthalmologist. An eye doctor can perform a complete eye exam.","Even after you get a diagnosis of wet macular degeneration, you can take some steps that may help slow vision loss.
Don't smoke.If you smoke, ask a healthcare professional for help quitting.
Choose a healthy diet.The antioxidant vitamins in fruits and vegetables contribute to eye health. Kale, spinach, broccoli, squash and other vegetables have high levels of antioxidants, including lutein and zeaxanthin. These nutrients may benefit people with macular degeneration.Eating foods with high levels of zinc also may be helpful for people with macular degeneration. These include high-protein foods, such as beef, pork and lamb. Nonmeat sources include milk, cheese, yogurt, whole-grain cereals and whole-wheat bread.Another good choice is healthy unsaturated fat, such as in olive oil. And research studies have shown that a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as in salmon, tuna and walnuts, may lower the risk of advanced macular degeneration. But the same benefit is not shown from taking omega-3 supplements, such as fish oil pills.
Manage your other medical conditions.If you have cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure, for example, take your medicine and follow your healthcare team's instructions for controlling the condition.
Maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly.If you need to lose weight, reduce the number of calories you eat and increase the amount of exercise you get each day.
Have routine eye exams.Ask your eye doctor about the recommended schedule for follow-up exams. In between checkups, you can do a self-assessment of your vision using an Amsler grid."
Myelofibrosis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myelofibrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355057,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myelofibrosis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355062,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myelofibrosis/doctors-departments/ddc-20355064,"Myelofibrosis is a kind of bone marrow cancer. Bone marrow is the soft matter inside the bones where blood cells are made. Myelofibrosis causes scarring in the bone marrow. This makes it hard for the bone marrow to make healthy blood cells.
Myelofibrosis sometimes happens on its own. This is called primary myelofibrosis. Sometimes it's caused by another blood cell condition. When this happens, it's called secondary myelofibrosis.
Some people with myelofibrosis have no symptoms and might not need treatment right away. Others with more-serious forms of the disease might need treatment. Treatment for myelofibrosis typically focuses on relieving symptoms.
Myelofibrosis belongs to a group of cancers called myeloproliferative neoplasms. These cancers cause the body to make too many blood cells that don't work right. Myelofibrosis and the other myeloproliferative neoplasms can lead to different types of leukemia. Leukemia is cancer that affects the blood-forming tissues in the body.","Myelofibrosis signs and symptoms may include:
Feeling tired, weak or short of breath.
Pain or fullness below the ribs on the left side.
Easy bruising.
Easy bleeding.
Sweating a lot while sleeping, so that you wake feeling covered in sweat.
Fever.
Bone pain.
Feeling full after eating a small amount of food.",Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you.,"It's often not clear what causes myelofibrosis. This cancer happens in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft matter inside the bones where blood cells are made.
The bone marrow makes cells called blood stem cells that can become other kinds of cells. When needed, these stem cells can turn into the blood cells that circulate through the body. Blood stem cells can become:
Red blood cells that carry oxygen to the body.
White blood cells that help fight infections.
Platelets that help stop bleeding.
Myelofibrosis starts when blood stem cells in the bone marrow develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy blood stem cells, the DNA gives instructions to turn into blood cells in a controlled way.
In myelofibrosis, the DNA changes give different instructions to the blood stem cells. The changes tell the blood stem cells to make more blood cells than the body needs. The blood cells don't work like healthy blood cells.
Myelofibrosis also causes scarring in the bone marrow. The scarring makes it hard for the bone marrow to make healthy blood cells.
The extra blood cells that don't work right and the bone marrow scarring both can cause too few healthy blood cells in the body. This leads to the symptoms of myelofibrosis. For example, feeling weak and tired can happen if there are too few red blood cells to carry oxygen in the blood.
Healthcare professionals have discovered some genetic changes in the DNA that can cause myelofibrosis, including changes to the:
Janus kinase 2 gene, also called JAK2.
Calreticulin gene, also called CALR.
Thrombopoietin receptor gene, also called MPL.
Your healthcare team might test your cancer cells to see if these changes are present. The results can impact your prognosis and your treatment options.","Although the cause of myelofibrosis often isn't known, healthcare professionals have found some things that might raise the risk. Risk factors include:
Increasing age.Myelofibrosis can affect anyone, but it's most often diagnosed in people older than 50.
Another blood cell condition.A small portion of people with myelofibrosis develop the condition as a complication of essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera.
Exposure to benzene.Myelofibrosis has been linked to high levels of exposure to the industrial chemical benzene.
Exposure to radiation.People exposed to very high doses of radiation have an increased risk of myelofibrosis.",,,Myelofibrosis diagnosis often starts with a physical exam. Other tests that can help diagnose this bone marrow cancer include blood tests and imaging tests. A healthcare professional may take a sample of your bone marrow for testing.,"Treatments for myelofibrosis include blood transfusions and medicines, such as chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Other treatments include surgery to remove the spleen, radiation therapy and bone marrow transplant, also called stem cell transplant.
The goal of treatment for most people with myelofibrosis is to provide relief from symptoms of the disease. For some, a bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, may provide a chance for a cure. This treatment can be very hard on the body, and it might not be an option for many people.
To find out which myelofibrosis treatments are most likely to benefit you, your healthcare professional may use one or more formulas to assess your condition. These formulas take into account many aspects of your cancer and your overall health. A healthcare professional may assign a risk category that indicates how serious your condition is.
A lower risk myelofibrosis might grow slowly. Treatment might not be needed right away, or treatment might focus on controlling any symptoms. A higher risk myelofibrosis might be getting worse quickly. People with higher risk myelofibrosis might consider stronger treatments, such as a bone marrow transplant.","A myelofibrosis diagnosis can cause strong feelings. Some people say they felt shocked, scared or sad when they got their diagnosis. With time, each person finds a way to cope with these feelings. Until you find what works for you, here are some ideas to help you cope.","Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you. If your healthcare professional thinks that you have myelofibrosis, that person may refer you to a specialist. Often, this is a doctor who specializes in blood diseases, called a hematologist.
Appointments can be short and being prepared can help. Here's some information that may help you get ready.",
Guillain-Barre syndrome,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362793,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20363006,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/doctors-departments/ddc-20363037,"Guillain-Barre (gee-YAH-buh-RAY) syndrome is a condition in which the body's immune system attacks the nerves. It can cause weakness, numbness or paralysis.
Weakness and tingling in the hands and feet are usually the first symptoms. These sensations can quickly spread and may lead to paralysis. In its most serious form, Guillain-Barre syndrome is a medical emergency. Most people with the condition need treatment in a hospital.
Guillain-Barre syndrome is rare, and the exact cause is not known. But two-thirds of people have symptoms of an infection in the six weeks before Guillain-Barre symptoms begin. Infections can include a respiratory or a gastrointestinal infection, includingCOVID-19. Guillain-Barre also can be caused by the Zika virus.
There's no known cure for Guillain-Barre syndrome. Several treatment options can ease symptoms and help speed recovery. Most people recover completely from Guillain-Barre syndrome, but some serious illnesses can be fatal. While recovery may take up to several years, most people are able to walk again six months after symptoms first began. Some people may have lasting effects, such as weakness, numbness or fatigue.","Guillain-Barre syndrome often begins with tingling and weakness starting in the feet and legs and spreading to the upper body and arms. Some people notice the first symptoms in the arms or face. As Guillain-Barre syndrome progresses, muscle weakness can turn into paralysis.
Symptoms of Guillain-Barre syndrome may include:
A pins and needles feeling in the fingers, toes, ankles or wrists.
Weakness in the legs that spreads to the upper body.
Unsteady walk or not being able to walk or climb stairs.
Trouble with facial movements, including speaking, chewing or swallowing.
Double vision or inability to move the eyes.
Severe pain that may feel achy, shooting or cramplike and may be worse at night.
Trouble with bladder control or bowel function.
Rapid heart rate.
Low or high blood pressure.
Trouble breathing.
People with Guillain-Barre syndrome usually experience their most significant weakness within two weeks after symptoms begin.","Call your healthcare professional if you have mild tingling in your toes or fingers that doesn't seem to be spreading or getting worse. Seek emergency medical help if you have any of these serious symptoms:
Tingling that started in your feet or toes and is now moving up your body.
Tingling or weakness that's spreading quickly.
Trouble catching your breath or shortness of breath when lying flat.
Choking on saliva.
Guillain-Barre syndrome is a serious condition that requires immediate hospitalization because it can worsen quickly. The sooner treatment is started, the better the chance of a complete recovery.","The exact cause of Guillain-Barre syndrome isn't known. It usually appears days or weeks after a respiratory or digestive tract infection. Rarely, recent surgery or vaccination can trigger Guillain-Barre syndrome.
In Guillain-Barre syndrome, your immune system — which usually attacks only invading organisms — begins attacking the nerves. InAIDP, the nerves' protective covering, known as the myelin sheath, is damaged. The damage prevents nerves from transmitting signals to your brain, causing weakness, numbness or paralysis.
Guillain-Barre syndrome may be triggered by:
Most commonly, an infection with campylobacter, a type of bacteria often found in undercooked poultry.
Influenza virus.
Cytomegalovirus.
Epstein-Barr virus.
Zika virus.
Hepatitis A, B, C and E.
HIV, the virus that causesAIDS.
Mycoplasma pneumonia.
Surgery.
Trauma.
Hodgkin lymphoma.
Rarely, influenza vaccinations or childhood vaccinations.
COVID-19virus.","Guillain-Barre syndrome can affect all age groups, but the risk increases as you age. It's also slightly more common in males than females.","Guillain-Barre syndrome affects your nerves. Because nerves control your movements and body functions, people with Guillain-Barre syndrome may experience:
Trouble breathing.Weakness or paralysis can spread to the muscles that control your breathing. This can potentially be fatal. Up to 22% of people with Guillain-Barre syndrome need temporary help from a machine to breathe within the first week when they're hospitalized for treatment.
Residual numbness or other sensations.Most people with Guillain-Barre syndrome recover completely or have only minor, residual weakness, numbness or tingling.
Heart and blood pressure problems.Blood pressure fluctuations and irregular heart rhythms are common side effects of Guillain-Barre syndrome.
Pain.One-third of people with Guillain-Barre syndrome experience nerve pain, which may be eased with medicine.
Trouble with bowel and bladder function.Sluggish bowel function and urine retention may result from Guillain-Barre syndrome.
Blood clots.People who are not mobile due to Guillain-Barre syndrome are at risk of developing blood clots. Until you're able to walk independently, you may need to take blood thinners and wear support stockings to improve blood flow.
Pressure sores.You may be at risk of developing bedsores, also known as pressure sores, if you're not able to move. Changing your position often may help avoid this problem.
Relapse.A small percentage of people with Guillain-Barre syndrome have a relapse. A relapse can cause muscle weakness even years after symptoms ended.
When early symptoms are worse, the risk of serious long-term complications goes up. Rarely, death may occur from complications such as respiratory distress syndrome and heart attacks.",,"Guillain-Barre syndrome can be hard to diagnose in its earliest stages. Its symptoms are similar to those of other conditions and may vary from person to person.
Your healthcare professional starts with a medical history and thorough physical exam.
Your healthcare professional may then recommend:
Spinal tap, also known as a lumbar puncture.A small amount of fluid is withdrawn from the spinal canal in your lower back. The fluid is tested for a type of change that commonly occurs in people who have Guillain-Barre syndrome.
Electromyography.Thin-needle electrodes are inserted into the muscles to measure nerve activity.
Nerve conduction studies.Electrodes are taped to the skin above your nerves. A small shock is passed through the nerve to measure the speed of nerve signals.","There's no cure for Guillain-Barre syndrome. But two types of treatments can speed recovery and reduce symptoms:
Plasma exchange, also known as plasmapheresis.Plasma is the liquid portion of part of your blood. In a plasma exchange, plasma is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then put back into your body, which makes more plasma to replace what was removed. Plasmapheresis may work by ridding plasma of certain antibodies that contribute to the immune system's attack on the peripheral nerves.
Immunoglobulin therapy.Immunoglobulin containing healthy antibodies from blood donors is given through a vein. High doses of immunoglobulin can block the damaging antibodies that may contribute to Guillain-Barre syndrome.
These treatments are equally effective. Mixing them or using one after the other is no more effective than using either method alone.
You are also likely to be given medicine to:
Relieve pain, which can be severe.
Prevent blood clots, which can develop if you're not mobile.
People with Guillain-Barre syndrome need physical help and therapy before and during recovery. Your care may include:
Movement of your arms and legs by caregivers before recovery, to help keep your muscles flexible and strong.
Physical therapy during recovery to help you cope with fatigue and regain strength and proper movement.
Training with adaptive devices, such as a wheelchair or braces, to give you mobility and self-care skills.","A diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome can be emotionally hard. Although most people eventually recover fully, the condition is generally painful and requires hospitalization and months of rehabilitation. People with Guillain-Barre syndrome must adjust to limited mobility and fatigue.
To manage the stress of recovery from Guillain-Barre syndrome, consider these suggestions:
Maintain a strong support system of friends and family.
Contact a support group, for yourself or for family members.
Discuss your feelings and concerns with a counselor.","You may be referred to a doctor who specializes in disorders of the brain and nervous system, known as a neurologist.",
HIV/AIDS,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiv-aids/symptoms-causes/syc-20373524,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiv-aids/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20373531,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiv-aids/doctors-departments/ddc-20373532,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is an ongoing, also called chronic, condition. It's caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, also called HIV.HIVdamages the immune system so that the body is less able to fight infection and disease. IfHIVisn't treated, it can take years before it weakens the immune system enough to becomeAIDS. Thanks to treatment, most people in the U.S. don't getAIDS.
HIVis spread through contact with genitals, such as during sex without a condom. This type of infection is called a sexually transmitted infection, also called an STI.HIValso is spread through contact with blood, such as when people share needles or syringes. It is also possible for a person with untreatedHIVto spread the virus to a child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.
There's no cure forHIV/AIDS. But medicines can control the infection and keep the disease from getting worse. Antiviral treatments forHIVhave reducedAIDSdeaths around the world. There's an ongoing effort to make ways to prevent and treatHIV/AIDSmore available in resource-poor countries.",The symptoms ofHIVandAIDSvary depending on the person and the phase of infection.,"If you think you may have been infected withHIVor are at risk of contracting the virus, see a healthcare professional as soon as you can.","HIVis caused by a virus. It can spread through sexual contact, shooting of illicit drugs or use of shared needles, and contact with infected blood. It also can spread from parent to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.
HIVdestroys white blood cells called CD4 T cells. These cells play a large role in helping the body fight disease. The fewer CD4 T cells you have, the weaker your immune system becomes.","Anyone of any age, race, sex or sexual orientation can haveHIV/AIDS. However, you're at greatest risk ofHIV/AIDSif you:
Have unprotected sex.Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex. Anal sex is riskier than is vaginal sex. Your risk ofHIVincreases if you have more than one sexual partner.
Have anSTI.ManySTIscause open sores on the genitals. These sores allowHIVto enter the body.
Inject illicit drugs.If you share needles and syringes, you can be exposed to infected blood.",HIVinfection weakens your immune system. The infection makes you much more likely to get many infections and certain types of cancers.,"There's no vaccine to preventHIVinfection and no cure forHIV/AIDS. But you can protect yourself and others from infection.
To help prevent the spread ofHIV:
Consider preexposure prophylaxis, also called PrEP.There are twoPrEPmedicines taken by mouth, also called oral, and onePrEPmedicine given in the form of a shot, called injectable. The oral medicines are emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) and emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Descovy). The injectable medicine is called cabotegravir (Apretude).PrEPcan reduce the risk of sexually transmittedHIVinfection in people at very high risk.PrEPcan reduce the risk of gettingHIVfrom sex by about 99% and from injecting drugs by at least 74%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Descovy hasn't been studied in people who have sex by having a penis put into their vaginas, called receptive vaginal sex.Cabotegravir (Apretude) is the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approvedPrEPthat can be given as a shot to reduce the risk of sexually transmittedHIVinfection in people at very high risk. A healthcare professional gives the shot. After two once-monthly shots, Apretude is given every two months. The shot is an option in place of a dailyPrEPpill.Your healthcare professional prescribes these medicines to preventHIVonly to people who don't already haveHIVinfection. You need anHIVtest before you start taking anyPrEP. You need to take the test every three months for the pills or before each shot for as long as you takePrEP.You need to take the pills every day or closely follow the shot schedule. You still need to practice safe sex to protect against otherSTIs. If you have hepatitis B, you should see an infectious disease or liver specialist before beginningPrEPtherapy.
Use treatment as prevention, also called TasP.If you haveHIV, takingHIVmedicines can keep your partner from getting infected with the virus. If your blood tests show no virus, that means your viral load can't be detected. Then you won't transmit the virus to anyone else through sex.If you useTasP, you must take your medicines exactly as prescribed and get regular checkups.
Use post-exposure prophylaxis, also called PEP, if you've been exposed toHIV.If you think you've been exposed through sex, through needles or in the workplace, contact your healthcare professional or go to an emergency room. TakingPEPas soon as you can within the first 72 hours can greatly reduce your risk of gettingHIV. You need to take the medicine for 28 days.
Use a new condom every time you have anal or vaginal sex.Both male and female condoms are available. If you use a lubricant, make sure it's water based. Oil-based lubricants can weaken condoms and cause them to break.During oral sex, use a cut-open condom or a piece of medical-grade latex called a dental dam without a lubricant.
Tell your sexual partners you haveHIV.It's important to tell all your current and past sexual partners that you'reHIVpositive. They need to be tested.
Use clean needles.If you use needles to inject illicit drugs, make sure the needles are sterile. Don't share them. Use needle-exchange programs in your community. Seek help for your drug use.
If you're pregnant, get medical care right away.You can passHIVto your baby. But if you get treatment during pregnancy, you can lessen your baby's risk greatly.
Consider male circumcision.Studies show that removing the foreskin from the penis, called circumcision, can help reduce the risk of gettingHIVinfection.","HIVcan be diagnosed through blood or saliva testing. Tests include:
Antigen-antibody tests.These tests most often use blood from a vein. Antigens are substances on theHIVvirus itself. They most often show up in the blood within a few weeks after being exposed toHIV.The immune system makes antibodies when it's exposed toHIV. It can take weeks to months for antibodies to show up in blood. You may not show a positive result on an antigen-antibody test until 2 to 6 weeks after exposure toHIV.
Antibody tests.These tests look for antibodies toHIVin blood or saliva. Most rapidHIVtests are antibody tests. This includes self-tests done at home. You may not show a positive result on an antibody test until 3 to 12 weeks after you've been exposed toHIV.
Nucleic acid tests (NATs).These tests look for the virus in your blood, called viral load. They use blood from a vein.If you might have been exposed toHIVwithin the past few weeks, your healthcare professional may suggestNAT.NATis the first test to become positive after exposure toHIV.
Talk with your healthcare professional about whichHIVtest is right for you. If any of these tests are negative, you may need a follow-up test weeks to months later to confirm the results.","There's no cure forHIV/AIDS. Once you have the infection, your body can't get rid of it. But there are medicines that can controlHIVand prevent complications.
Everyone diagnosed withHIVshould take antiretroviral therapy medicines, also called ART. This is true no matter what stage the disease is in or what the complications are.
ARTis usually a mix of two or more medicines from several classes. This approach has the best chance of lowering the amount ofHIVin the blood. There are manyARToptions that mix more than oneHIVmedicine into a single pill, taken once daily.
Each class of medicines blocks the virus in different ways. Treatment involves mixing medicines from different classes to:
Account for medicine resistance, called viral genotype.
Keep from creating new medicine-resistant strains ofHIV.
Suppress the virus in the blood as much as possible.
Two medicines from one class, plus a third medicine from another class, are most often used.
The classes of anti-HIVmedicines include the following:
Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)turn off a protein needed byHIVto make copies of itself.Examples include efavirenz, rilpivirine (Edurant) and doravirine (Pifeltro).
Nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)are faulty versions of the building blocks thatHIVneeds to make copies of itself.Examples include abacavir (Ziagen), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread), emtricitabine (Emtriva), lamivudine (Epivir) and zidovudine (Retrovir). Retrovir is no longer suggested for routine use in the U.S. because of high rates of toxic effects.Mixes of medicines also are available, such as emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) and emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Descovy).
Protease inhibitors (PIs)makeHIVprotease inactive.HIVprotease is another protein thatHIVneeds to make copies of itself.Examples include atazanavir (Reyataz), darunavir (Prezista) and lopinavir-ritonavir (Kaletra).
Integrase inhibitorsstop the action of a protein called integrase.HIVuses integrase to put its genetic material into CD4 T cells.Examples include bictegravir sodium-emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Biktarvy), raltegravir (Isentress), dolutegravir (Tivicay) and cabotegravir (Vocabria).
Entry or fusion inhibitorsblockHIV'sentry into CD4 T cells.Examples include enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) and maraviroc (Selzentry). Newer medicines include ibalizumab-uiyk (Trogarzo) and fostemsavir (Rukobia).","Getting a diagnosis of any life-threatening illness can cause distress. The emotional, social and financial effects ofHIV/AIDScan make coping with this illness very hard for you and for those close to you.
But there are many services and resources for people withHIV. MostHIV/AIDSclinics have social workers, counselors or nurses who can help you or put you in touch with people who can help you.
They may be able to:
Arrange transportation to and from medical appointments.
Help with housing and child care.
Assist with employment and legal issues.
Provide support during financial crises.
It's important to have a support system. Many people withHIV/AIDSfind that talking with someone who knows about their disease gives them comfort.","If you think you might have anHIVinfection, you're likely to start by seeing your family healthcare professional. You may be sent to an infectious disease specialist who focuses on treatingHIV/AIDS.","Besides getting medical treatment, you need to take an active role in your own care. The following may help you stay healthy longer:
Eat healthy foods.Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein help keep you strong, give you more energy and support your immune system. Eat enough calories to keep your weight stable.
Avoid raw meat, eggs and more.Foodborne illnesses can be severe in people who are infected withHIV. Cook meat until it's well done. Don't use dairy products that aren't treated for bacteria, called pasteurized. Don't eat raw eggs and raw seafood such as oysters, sushi or sashimi. Don't drink water you don't know is safe.
Get the right vaccinations.These may prevent common infections such as pneumonia, influenza,COVID-19and mpox. Your healthcare professional also may suggest other vaccinations, including those forHPV, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Vaccines that don't have live viruses mostly are safe. But most vaccines with live viruses are not safe because of your weakened immune system.
Take care with pets.Some animals may carry parasites that can cause infections in people who areHIVpositive. Cat stool can cause toxoplasmosis, reptiles can carry salmonella, and birds can carry cryptococcus or histoplasmosis. Wash hands thoroughly after handling pets or emptying litter boxes."
Alcohol use disorder,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-use-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20369243,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-use-disorder/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369250,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-use-disorder/doctors-departments/ddc-20369252,"Alcohol use disorder is a pattern of alcohol use that involves problems controlling your drinking, being preoccupied with alcohol or continuing to use alcohol even when it causes problems. This disorder also involves having to drink more to get the same effect or having withdrawal symptoms when you rapidly decrease or stop drinking. Alcohol use disorder includes a level of drinking that's sometimes called alcoholism.
Unhealthy alcohol use includes any alcohol use that puts your health or safety at risk or causes other alcohol-related problems. It also includes binge drinking — a pattern of drinking where a male has five or more drinks within two hours or a female has at least four drinks within two hours. Binge drinking causes significant health and safety risks.
If your pattern of drinking results in repeated significant distress and problems functioning in your daily life, you likely have alcohol use disorder. It can range from mild to severe. However, even a mild disorder can escalate and lead to serious problems, so early treatment is important.","Alcohol use disorder can be mild, moderate or severe, based on the number of symptoms you experience. Signs and symptoms may include:
Being unable to limit the amount of alcohol you drink
Wanting to cut down on how much you drink or making unsuccessful attempts to do so
Spending a lot of time drinking, getting alcohol or recovering from alcohol use
Feeling a strong craving or urge to drink alcohol
Failing to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home due to repeated alcohol use
Continuing to drink alcohol even though you know it's causing physical, social, work or relationship problems
Giving up or reducing social and work activities and hobbies to use alcohol
Using alcohol in situations where it's not safe, such as when driving or swimming
Developing a tolerance to alcohol so you need more to feel its effect or you have a reduced effect from the same amount
Experiencing withdrawal symptoms — such as nausea, sweating and shaking — when you don't drink, or drinking to avoid these symptoms
Alcohol use disorder can include periods of being drunk (alcohol intoxication) and symptoms of withdrawal.
Alcohol intoxicationresults as the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream increases. The higher the blood alcohol concentration is, the more likely you are to have bad effects. Alcohol intoxication causes behavior problems and mental changes. These may include inappropriate behavior, unstable moods, poor judgment, slurred speech, problems with attention or memory, and poor coordination. You can also have periods called ""blackouts,"" where you don't remember events. Very high blood alcohol levels can lead to coma, permanent brain damage or even death.
Alcohol withdrawalcan occur when alcohol use has been heavy and prolonged and is then stopped or greatly reduced. It can occur within several hours to 4 to 5 days later. Signs and symptoms include sweating, rapid heartbeat, hand tremors, problems sleeping, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, restlessness and agitation, anxiety, and occasionally seizures. Symptoms can be severe enough to impair your ability to function at work or in social situations.","If you feel that you sometimes drink too much alcohol, or your drinking is causing problems, or if your family is concerned about your drinking, talk with your health care provider. Other ways to get help include talking with a mental health professional or seeking help from a support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar type of self-help group.
Because denial is common, you may feel like you don't have a problem with drinking. You might not recognize how much you drink or how many problems in your life are related to alcohol use. Listen to relatives, friends or co-workers when they ask you to examine your drinking habits or to seek help. Consider talking with someone who has had a problem with drinking but has stopped.","Genetic, psychological, social and environmental factors can impact how drinking alcohol affects your body and behavior. Theories suggest that for certain people drinking has a different and stronger impact that can lead to alcohol use disorder.
Over time, drinking too much alcohol may change the normal function of the areas of your brain associated with the experience of pleasure, judgment and the ability to exercise control over your behavior. This may result in craving alcohol to try to restore good feelings or reduce negative ones.","Alcohol use may begin in the teens, but alcohol use disorder occurs more frequently in the 20s and 30s, though it can start at any age.
Risk factors for alcohol use disorder include:
Steady drinking over time.Drinking too much on a regular basis for an extended period or binge drinking on a regular basis can lead to alcohol-related problems or alcohol use disorder.
Starting at an early age.People who begin drinking — especially binge drinking — at an early age are at a higher risk of alcohol use disorder.
Family history.The risk of alcohol use disorder is higher for people who have a parent or other close relative who has problems with alcohol. This may be influenced by genetic factors.
Depression and other mental health problems.It's common for people with a mental health disorder such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder to have problems with alcohol or other substances.
History of trauma.People with a history of emotional trauma or other trauma are at increased risk of alcohol use disorder.
Having bariatric surgery.Some research studies indicate that having bariatric surgery may increase the risk of developing alcohol use disorder or of relapsing after recovering from alcohol use disorder.
Social and cultural factors.Having friends or a close partner who drinks regularly could increase your risk of alcohol use disorder. The glamorous way that drinking is sometimes portrayed in the media also may send the message that it's OK to drink too much. For young people, the influence of parents, peers and other role models can impact risk.","Alcohol depresses your central nervous system. In some people, the initial reaction may feel like an increase in energy. But as you continue to drink, you become drowsy and have less control over your actions.
Too much alcohol affects your speech, muscle coordination and vital centers of your brain. A heavy drinking binge may even cause a life-threatening coma or death. This is of particular concern when you're taking certain medications that also depress the brain's function.","Early intervention can prevent alcohol-related problems in teens. If you have a teenager, be alert to signs and symptoms that may indicate a problem with alcohol:
Loss of interest in activities and hobbies and in personal appearance
Red eyes, slurred speech, problems with coordination and memory lapses
Difficulties or changes in relationships with friends, such as joining a new crowd
Declining grades and problems in school
Frequent mood changes and defensive behavior
You can help prevent teenage alcohol use:
Set a good example with your own alcohol use.
Talk openly with your child, spend quality time together and become actively involved in your child's life.
Let your child know what behavior you expect — and what the consequences will be for not following the rules.","You're likely to start by seeing your primary health care provider. If your provider suspects that you have a problem with alcohol, you may be referred to a mental health provider.
To assess your problem with alcohol, your provider will likely:
Ask you some questions related to your drinking habits.The provider may ask for permission to speak with family members or friends. However, confidentiality laws prevent your provider from giving out any information about you without your consent.
Perform a physical exam.Your health care provider may do a physical exam and ask questions about your health. There are many physical signs that indicate complications of alcohol use.
Suggest lab tests and imaging tests.While there are no specific tests to diagnose alcohol use disorder, certain patterns of lab test results may strongly suggest it. And you may need tests to identify health problems that may be linked to your alcohol use. Damage to your organs may be seen on tests.
Complete a psychological evaluation.This evaluation includes questions about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may be asked to complete a questionnaire to help answer these questions.","Treatment for alcohol use disorder can vary, depending on your needs. Treatment may involve a brief intervention, individual or group counseling, an outpatient program, or a residential inpatient stay. Working to stop alcohol use to improve quality of life is the main treatment goal.
Treatment for alcohol use disorder may include:
Detox and withdrawal.Treatment may begin with a program of detoxification — withdrawal that's medically managed. Sometimes called detox, this generally takes 2 to 7 days. You may need to take sedating medications to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Detox is usually done at an inpatient treatment center or a hospital.
Learning new skills and making a treatment plan.This process usually involves alcohol treatment specialists. It may include goal setting, behavior change techniques, use of self-help manuals, counseling and follow-up care at a treatment center.
Psychological counseling.Counseling and therapy for groups and individuals help you better understand your problem with alcohol and support recovery from the psychological aspects of alcohol use. You may benefit from couples or family therapy — family support can be an important part of the recovery process.
Oral medications.A drug called disulfiram may help prevent you from drinking, although it won't cure alcohol use disorder or remove the urge to drink. If you drink alcohol while taking disulfiram, the drug produces a physical reaction that may include flushing, nausea, vomiting and headaches.Naltrexone, a drug that blocks the good feelings alcohol causes, may prevent heavy drinking and reduce the urge to drink. Acamprosate may help you combat alcohol cravings once you stop drinking. Unlike disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate don't make you feel sick after taking a drink.
Injected medication.Vivitrol, a version of the drug naltrexone, is injected once a month by a health care professional. Although similar medication can be taken in pill form, the injectable version of the drug may be easier for people recovering from alcohol use disorder to use consistently.
Continuing support.Aftercare programs and support groups help people recovering from alcohol use disorder to stop drinking, manage relapses and cope with necessary lifestyle changes. This may include medical or psychological care or attending a support group.
Treatment for psychological problems.Alcohol use disorder commonly occurs along with other mental health disorders. If you have depression, anxiety or another mental health condition, you may need talk therapy (psychotherapy), medications or other treatment.
Medical treatment for health conditions.Many alcohol-related health problems improve significantly once you stop drinking. But some health conditions may warrant continued treatment and follow-up care.
Spiritual practice.People who are involved with some type of regular spiritual practice may find it easier to maintain recovery from alcohol use disorder or other addictions. For many people, gaining greater insight into their spiritual side is a key element in recovery.","Many people with alcohol problems and their family members find that participating in support groups is an essential part of coping with the disease, preventing or dealing with relapses, and staying sober. Your health care provider or counselor can suggest a support group. These groups are also often listed on the web.
Here are a few examples:
Alcoholics Anonymous.Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a self-help group for people recovering from alcoholism. AA offers a sober peer group and is built around 12 steps as an effective model for achieving total abstinence.
Women for Sobriety.Women for Sobriety is a nonprofit organization offering a self-help group program for women who want to overcome alcoholism and other addictions. It focuses on developing coping skills related to emotional and spiritual growth, self-esteem, and a healthy lifestyle.
Al-Anon and Alateen.Al-Anon is designed for people who are affected by someone else's alcoholism. Alateen groups are available for teenage children of those with alcoholism. In sharing their stories, family members gain a greater understanding of how the disease affects the entire family.
Celebrate Recovery.Celebrate Recovery is a Christ-centered, 12-step recovery program for people struggling with addiction.
SMART Recovery.SMART Recovery offers mutual support meetings for people seeking science-based, self-empowered addiction recovery.","Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment, and what to expect from your health care provider or mental health provider.
Consider your drinking habits. Take an honest look at how often and how much you drink. Be prepared to discuss any problems that alcohol may be causing. You may want to take a family member or friend along, if possible.
Before your appointment, make a list of:
Any symptoms you've had,including any that may seem unrelated to your drinking
Key personal information,including any major stresses or recent life changes
All medications,vitamins, herbs or other supplements that you're taking and their dosages
Questions to askyour provider
Some questions to ask include:
Do you think I drink too much or show signs of problem drinking?
Do you think I need to cut back or quit drinking?
Do you think alcohol could be causing or worsening my other health problems?
What's the best course of action?
What are the alternatives to the approach that you're suggesting?
Do I need any medical tests for underlying physical problems?
Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can have? What websites do you recommend?
Would it be helpful for me to meet with a professional experienced in alcohol treatment?
Don't hesitate to ask any other questions.","As part of your recovery, you'll need to focus on changing your habits and making different lifestyle choices. These strategies may help:
Consider your social situation.Make it clear to your friends and family that you're not drinking alcohol. Develop a support system of friends and family who can support your recovery. You may need to distance yourself from friends and social situations that impair your recovery.
Develop healthy habits.For example, good sleep, regular physical activity, managing stress more effectively and eating well all can make it easier for you to recover from alcohol use disorder.
Do things that don't involve alcohol.You may find that many of your activities involve drinking. Replace them with hobbies or activities that are not centered around alcohol."
Alcoholic hepatitis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcoholic-hepatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351388,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcoholic-hepatitis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351394,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcoholic-hepatitis/doctors-departments/ddc-20351395,"Alcoholic hepatitis is swelling, called inflammation, of the liver caused by drinking alcohol. Drinking alcohol destroys liver cells.
Alcoholic hepatitis most often happens in people who drink heavily over many years. But the link between drinking and alcoholic hepatitis isn't simple. Not all heavy drinkers get alcoholic hepatitis. And some people who drink much less get the disease.
If you're diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis, you must stop drinking alcohol. People who keep drinking alcohol have a high risk of serious liver damage and death.","The most common sign of alcoholic hepatitis is yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, called jaundice. The yellowing of the skin might be harder to see on Black and brown people.
Other symptoms include:
Loss of appetite.
Nausea and vomiting.
Belly tenderness.
Fever, often low grade.
Tiredness and weakness.
People with alcoholic hepatitis tend to be malnourished. Drinking large amounts of alcohol keeps people from being hungry. And heavy drinkers get most of their calories from alcohol.
Other symptoms that happen with severe alcoholic hepatitis include:
Fluid buildup in the belly, called ascites.
Being confused and acting oddly due to a buildup of toxins. The healthy liver breaks these toxins down and gets rid of them.
Kidney and liver failure.","Alcoholic hepatitis is a serious, often deadly disease.
See a healthcare professional if you:
Have symptoms of alcoholic hepatitis.
Can't control your drinking.
Want help cutting back on your drinking.","Alcoholic hepatitis is caused by damage to the liver from drinking alcohol. Just how alcohol damages the liver and why it does so only in some heavy drinkers isn't clear.
These factors are known to play a role in alcoholic hepatitis:
The body's way of breaking down alcohol makes highly toxic chemicals.
These chemicals trigger swelling, called inflammation, that destroys liver cells.
Over time, scars replace healthy liver tissue. This keeps the liver from working well.
This scarring, called cirrhosis, can't be fixed. It's the final stage of alcoholic liver disease.
Other factors that can be involved with alcoholic hepatitis include:
Other types of liver disease.Alcoholic hepatitis can make chronic liver diseases worse. For instance, if you have hepatitis C and drink, even a little, you're more likely to get liver scarring than if you don't drink.
Lack of nutrition.Many people who drink heavily don't get enough nutrients because they eat poorly. And alcohol keeps the body from using nutrients as it should. Lack of nutrients can damage liver cells.","The major risk factor for alcoholic hepatitis is the how much alcohol you drink. It isn't known how much alcohol it takes to cause alcoholic hepatitis.
Most people with this condition have had at least seven drinks a day for 20 years or more. This can mean 7 glasses of wine, 7 beers, or 7 shots of spirits.
However, alcoholic hepatitis can happen to people who drink less and have other risk factors, including:
Sex.Women seem to have a higher risk of getting alcoholic hepatitis. That might be because of how alcohol breaks down in women's bodies.
Obesity.Heavy drinkers who are overweight might be more likely to get alcoholic hepatitis. And they might be more likely to go on to get liver scarring.
Genes.Studies suggest that genes might be involved in alcohol-induced liver disease.
Race and ethnicity.Black and Hispanic people might be at higher risk of alcoholic hepatitis.
Binge drinking.Having five or more drinks in about two hours for men and four or more for women might increase the risk of alcoholic hepatitis.","Complications of alcoholic hepatitis are caused by scar tissue on the liver. Scar tissue can slow blood flow through the liver. That can raise pressure in a major blood vessel called the portal vein and cause a buildup of toxins.
Complications include:
Enlarged veins, called varices.Blood that can't flow freely through the portal vein can back up into other blood vessels in the stomach and the tube through which food passes from the throat to the stomach, called the esophagus.These blood vessels have thin walls. They're likely to bleed if filled with too much blood. Heavy bleeding in the upper stomach or esophagus is life-threatening and needs medical care right away.
Ascites (ah-SITE-ees).Fluid that builds up in the belly might get infected and need treatment with antibiotics. Ascites isn't life-threatening. But it most often means advanced alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis.
Confusion, drowsiness and slurred speech, called hepatic encephalopathy.A damaged liver has trouble removing toxins from the body. The buildup of toxins can damage the brain. Severe hepatic encephalopathy can cause a coma.
Kidney failure.A damaged liver can affect blood flow to the kidneys. This can damage the kidneys.
Cirrhosis.This scarring of the liver can lead to liver failure.","You might reduce your risk of alcoholic hepatitis if you:
Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all.For healthy adults, moderate drinking means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. The only certain way to prevent alcoholic hepatitis is to avoid all alcohol.
Protect yourself from hepatitis C.Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by a virus. Without treatment, it can lead to cirrhosis. If you have hepatitis C and drink alcohol, you're far more likely to get cirrhosis than if you don't drink.
Check before mixing medicines and alcohol.Ask your healthcare professional if it's safe to drink alcohol when taking your prescribed medicines. Read the warning labels on medicines you can get without a prescription.Don't drink alcohol when taking medicines that warn against drinking alcohol while taking them. This includes pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).","Your healthcare professional does a physical exam and asks about your alcohol use, now and in the past. Be honest about your drinking. Your care professional might ask to talk to family members about your drinking.
Diagnosing liver disease might involve these tests:
Liver function tests.
Blood tests.
An ultrasound,CTorMRIscan of the liver.
A liver biopsy, if other tests and imaging don't give a clear diagnosis or if you are at risk of other causes of hepatitis.",Treatment for alcoholic hepatitis involves quitting drinking as well as therapies to ease the symptoms of liver damage.,,"You might be referred to a digestive disease specialist, called a gastroenterologist.",

Hay fever,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20373039,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20373045,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/doctors-departments/ddc-20373046,"Hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis, causes cold-like symptoms. These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).
Common allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.
Besides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.","Hay fever symptoms can include:
Runny nose and nasal stuffiness, called congestion.
Watery, itchy, red eyes.
Sneezing.
Cough.
Itchy nose, roof of mouth or throat.
Mucus that runs down the back of the throat, called postnasal drip.
Swollen, bruised-appearing skin under the eyes, known as allergic shiners.
Extreme tiredness and fatigue, often due to poor sleep.","See a healthcare professional if:
You can't find relief from your hay fever symptoms.
Allergy medicines don't provide relief, or they cause side effects.
You have another condition that can worsen hay fever symptoms, such as nasal polyps, asthma or frequent sinus infections.
Many people — especially children — get used to hay fever symptoms, so they might not seek treatment until the symptoms become severe. But getting the right treatment might offer relief.","When someone has hay fever, the immune system identifies a harmless airborne substance as being harmful. This substance is called an allergen. The body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against allergens. When the body comes in contact with an allergen, these antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever.","The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever:
Having other allergies or asthma.
Having a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy.
Having a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma.
Living or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites.
Being exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose.
Having a mother who smoked during the first year of life.","Problems that may go along with hay fever include:
Reduced quality of life.Hay fever can interfere with enjoyment of activities and cause you to be less productive. For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school.
Poor sleep.Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep. This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell, called malaise.
Worsening asthma.Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing.
Sinusitis.Prolonged sinus congestion due to hay fever may increase your risk of getting sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses.
Ear infection.In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection, called otitis media.","There's no way to avoid getting hay fever. If you have hay fever, the best thing to do is to lessen your exposure to the allergens that cause your symptoms. Take allergy medicines before you're exposed to allergens, as directed by your healthcare professional.","To diagnose hay fever, a healthcare professional typically does a physical exam and talks about general health, symptoms and possible triggers. One or both of these tests may be recommended:
Skin prick test.Small amounts of material that can trigger allergies are pricked into patches of skin on the arm or upper back. A medical professional then watches the skin for an allergic reaction. If someone has an allergy, a raised bump called a hive forms at the site of that allergen. This typically takes about 15 to 20 minutes. Allergy specialists usually are best equipped to perform allergy skin tests.
Allergy blood test.A blood sample is sent to a lab to measure the immune system's response to a specific allergen. This test measures the amount of allergy-causing antibodies in the bloodstream, known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies.","Once someone knows their allergy triggers, a healthcare professional can help develop a treatment plan to reduce or get rid of hay fever symptoms.
It's best to limit exposure to substances that cause hay fever. If hay fever isn't too severe, nonprescription medicines may be enough to relieve symptoms. For worse symptoms, prescription medicines may be needed.
Many people get the best relief from a combination of allergy medicines. Sometimes, a few different options need to be tried before finding what works best.
If a child has hay fever, talk with the child's healthcare professional about treatment. Not all medicines are approved for use in children. Read labels carefully.
Treatments for hay fever may include medicines, immunotherapy and nasal saline rinses.",,"You're likely to start by seeing your primary healthcare professional. However, in some cases when you call to set up an appointment, you may be referred to an allergist or other specialist.
Take a family member or friend along, if possible. Someone who accompanies you can help you remember information.
Here's some information to help you prepare for your appointment. Before your appointment, make a list of:
Your symptoms,when they occur and what seems to trigger them. Include symptoms that might seem unrelated to hay fever.
Recent life changes,such as a move to a new home or new part of the country.
All medicines you take,including vitamins, herbs and supplements, and their dosages.
Questionsto ask during your appointment.
For hay fever, questions to ask include:
What is likely causing my symptoms?
What tests do I need?
Is my condition likely to go away on its own?

Dust mite allergy,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dust-mites/symptoms-causes/syc-20352173,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dust-mites/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352178,,"Dust mite allergy is an allergic reaction to tiny bugs that commonly live in house dust. Signs of dust mite allergy include those common to hay fever, such as sneezing and runny nose. Many people with dust mite allergy also experience signs of asthma, such as wheezing and difficulty breathing.

Dust mites, close relatives of ticks and spiders, are too small to see without a microscope. Dust mites eat skin cells shed by people, and they thrive in warm, humid environments. In most homes, such items as bedding, upholstered furniture and carpeting provide an ideal environment for dust mites.

By taking steps to reduce the number of dust mites in your home, you may get control of dust mite allergy. Medications or other treatments are sometimes necessary to relieve symptoms and manage asthma.","Dust mite allergy symptoms caused by inflammation of nasal passages include:

If your dust mite allergy contributes to asthma, you may also experience:

A dust mite allergy can range from mild to severe. A mild case of dust mite allergy may cause an occasional runny nose, watery eyes and sneezing. In severe cases, the condition may be ongoing (chronic), resulting in persistent sneezing, cough, congestion, facial pressure, an eczema flare-up or severe asthma attack.","Some signs and symptoms of dust mite allergy, such as a runny nose or sneezing, are similar to those of the common cold. Sometimes it's difficult to know whether you have a cold or an allergy. If symptoms persist for longer than one week, you might have an allergy.

If your signs and symptoms are severe — such as severe nasal congestion, wheezing or difficulty sleeping — call your doctor. Seek emergency care if wheezing or shortness of breath rapidly worsens or if you are short of breath with minimal activity.","Allergies occur when your immune system reacts to a foreign substance such as pollen, pet dander or dust mites. Your immune system produces proteins known as antibodies that protect you from unwanted invaders that could make you sick or cause an infection.

When you have allergies, your immune system makes antibodies that identify your particular allergen as something harmful, even though it isn't. When you come into contact with the allergen, your immune system produces an inflammatory response in your nasal passages or lungs. Prolonged or regular exposure to the allergen can cause the ongoing (chronic) inflammation associated with asthma.

Dust mites eat organic matter such as skin cells people have shed, and rather than drinking water, they absorb water from humidity in the atmosphere.

Dust also contains the feces and decaying bodies of dust mites, and it's the proteins present in this dust mite ""debris"" that are the culprit in dust mite allergy.",The following factors increase your risk of developing a dust mite allergy:,"If you have a dust mite allergy, exposure to the mites and their debris can cause complications.",,"Your doctor may suspect dust mite allergy based on symptoms and your answers to questions about your home.

To confirm that you're allergic to some airborne substance, your doctor may use a lighted instrument to look at the condition of the lining of your nose. If you have an allergy to something airborne, the lining of the nasal passage will be swollen and may appear pale or bluish.

Your doctor may suspect a dust mite allergy if your symptoms are worse when you go to bed or while cleaning — when dust mite allergens would be temporarily airborne. If you have a pet, it may be more difficult to determine the cause of the allergy, particularly if your pet sleeps in your bedroom.

Allergy skin test.Your doctor may suggest an allergy skin test to determine what you're allergic to. You may be referred to an allergy specialist (allergist) for this test.

In this test, tiny amounts of purified allergen extracts — including an extract for dust mites — are pricked onto your skin's surface. This is usually carried out on the forearm, but it may be done on the upper back.

Your doctor or nurse observes your skin for signs of allergic reactions after 15 minutes. If you're allergic to dust mites, you'll develop a red, itchy bump where the dust mite extract was pricked onto your skin. The most common side effects of these skin tests are itching and redness. These side effects usually go away within 30 minutes.","The first treatment for controlling dust mite allergy is avoiding dust mites as much as possible. When you minimize your exposure to dust mites, you can expect fewer or less severe allergic reactions. However, it's impossible to completely eliminate dust mites from your environment. You may also need medications to control symptoms.",,"If you have what seems like a constant runny nose, sneezing, wheezing, shortness of breath or other symptoms that may be related to an allergy, you'll probably start by seeing your family doctor or general practitioner. Because appointments can be brief and there's often a lot of ground to cover, it's a good idea to prepare before you go.",
Egg allergy,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/egg-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20372115,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/egg-allergy/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20372119,,"Eggs are one of the most common allergy-causing foods for children.

Egg allergy symptoms usually occur a few minutes to a few hours after eating eggs or foods containing eggs. Signs and symptoms range from mild to severe and can include skin rashes, hives, nasal congestion, and vomiting or other digestive problems. Rarely, egg allergy can cause anaphylaxis — a life-threatening reaction.

Egg allergy can occur as early as infancy. Most children, but not all, outgrow their egg allergy before adolescence.",Egg allergy reactions vary from person to person and usually occur soon after exposure to egg. Egg allergy symptoms can include:,"See a doctor if you or your child has signs or symptoms of a food allergy shortly after eating eggs or an egg-containing product. If possible, see the doctor when the allergic reaction is occurring. This may help in making a diagnosis.

If you or your child has signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, seek immediate emergency treatment and use an autoinjector if one has been prescribed.","An immune system overreaction causes food allergies. For egg allergy, the immune system mistakenly identifies certain egg proteins as harmful. When you or your child comes in contact with egg proteins, immune system cells (antibodies) recognize them and signal the immune system to release histamine and other chemicals that cause allergic signs and symptoms.

Both egg yolks and egg whites contain proteins that can cause allergies, but allergy to egg whites is most common. It's possible for breast-fed infants to have an allergic reaction to egg proteins in breast milk if the mother consumes eggs.",Certain factors can increase the risk of developing egg allergy:,"The most significant complication of egg allergy is having a severe allergic reaction requiring an epinephrine injection and emergency treatment.

The same immune system reaction that causes egg allergy can also cause other conditions. If you or your child has egg allergy, you or your child may be at increased risk of:","Here are some things you can do to avoid an allergic reaction, and to keep it from getting worse if one does occur.","To diagnose egg allergy, your doctor will use several approaches, including ruling out other conditions that could be causing symptoms. In many cases, what seems to be egg allergy is actually caused by food intolerance, which is generally less serious than food allergy and doesn't involve the immune system.

Your doctor takes a medical history and conducts a physical exam. He or she may also recommend one or more of the following tests:","The only way to prevent egg allergy symptoms is to avoid eggs or egg products. Some people with egg allergies, however, can tolerate foods that contain well-cooked eggs, such as baked goods.",,You'll likely begin by seeing your family doctor or pediatrician. You may be referred to a doctor who specializes in allergic disorders (allergist-immunologist). Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.,
Food allergy,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/food-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20355095,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/food-allergy/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355101,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/food-allergy/doctors-departments/ddc-20355105,"Food allergy is an immune system reaction that happens soon after eating a certain food. Even a tiny amount of the allergy-causing food can trigger symptoms such as hives, swollen airways and digestive problems. In some people, a food allergy can cause severe symptoms or even a life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis.
Food allergy affects an estimated 8% of children under age 5 and up to 4% of adults. While there's no cure, some children outgrow their food allergies as they get older.
It's easy to confuse a food allergy with a much more common reaction known as food intolerance. While bothersome, food intolerance is a less serious condition that does not involve the immune system.","For some people, an allergic reaction to a particular food may be uncomfortable but not severe. For other people, a food allergy reaction can be frightening and even life-threatening. Food allergy symptoms usually develop within a few minutes to two hours after eating the offending food. Rarely, symptoms may be delayed for several hours.
The most common food allergy symptoms include:
Tingling or itching in the mouth.
Hives, itching or eczema.
Swelling of the lips, face, tongue, and throat or other parts of the body.
Belly pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.
Wheezing, nasal congestion or trouble breathing.
Dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting.","See a healthcare professional or allergist if you have food allergy symptoms shortly after eating. If possible, see a care professional when the allergic reaction is occurring. This can help make a diagnosis.
Seek emergency treatment if you develop any symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as:
Constriction of airways that makes it difficult to breathe.
Shock with a severe drop in blood pressure.
Rapid pulse.
Dizziness or lightheadedness.","When you have a food allergy, your immune system mistakenly identifies a specific food or a substance in food as something harmful. In response, your immune system triggers cells to make an antibody known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) to recognize the allergy-causing food or food substance, called an allergen.
The next time you eat even the smallest amount of that food, IgE antibodies sense it. They then signal your immune system to release a chemical called histamine, as well as other chemicals, into your bloodstream. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms.
Most food allergies are triggered by certain proteins in:
Crustacean shellfish, such as shrimp, lobster and crab.
Peanuts.
Tree nuts, such as walnuts and pecans.
Fish.
Chicken eggs.
Cow's milk.
Wheat.
Soy.","Food allergy risk factors include:
Family history.You're at increased risk of food allergies if asthma, eczema, hives or allergies such as hay fever are common in your family.
Other allergies.If you're already allergic to one food, you may be at increased risk of becoming allergic to another. Similarly, if you have other types of allergic reactions, such as hay fever or eczema, your risk of having a food allergy is greater.
Age.Food allergies are more common in children, especially toddlers and infants. As children grow older, their digestive systems mature and their bodies are less likely to react to food components that trigger allergies.Fortunately, children typically outgrow allergies to milk, soy, wheat and eggs. Severe allergies and allergies to nuts and shellfish are more likely to be lifelong.
Asthma.Asthma and food allergy commonly occur together. When they do, both food allergy and asthma symptoms are more likely to be severe.
Factors that may increase your risk of developing an anaphylactic reaction include:
Having a history of asthma.
Being a teenager or younger.
Delaying use of epinephrine to treat your food allergy symptoms.
Not having hives or other skin symptoms.","Complications of food allergy can include:
Anaphylaxis.This is a life-threatening allergic reaction.
Atopic dermatitis, known as eczema.Food allergy may cause a skin reaction, such as eczema.",,"There's no perfect test used to confirm or rule out a food allergy. Your healthcare team will consider a few factors before making a diagnosis. These factors include:
Your symptoms.Give your care team a detailed history of your or your child's symptoms — which foods, and how much, seem to cause problems.
Your family history of allergies.Also share information about members of your family who have allergies of any kind.
A physical examination.A careful exam can often identify or exclude other medical problems.
A skin test.A skin prick test can determine whether you may react to a particular food. In this test, a small amount of the suspected food is placed on the skin of your forearm or back. A doctor or another healthcare professional then pricks your skin to allow a tiny amount of the substance beneath your skin surface.If you're allergic to a particular substance being tested, you develop a raised bump or reaction. However, a positive reaction to this test alone isn't enough to confirm a food allergy.
A blood test.A blood test can measure your immune system's response to particular foods by measuring the allergy-related antibody known as immunoglobulin E (IgE).For this test, a blood sample taken in your care professional's office is sent to a medical laboratory. It will then be tested for foods that could have caused an allergic reaction.
Elimination diet.You may be asked to eliminate suspect foods for a week or two and then add the food items back into your diet one at a time. This process can help link symptoms to specific foods. However, elimination diets aren't foolproof.An elimination diet can't tell you whether your reaction to a food is a true allergy instead of a food sensitivity. Also, if you've had a severe reaction to a food in the past, an elimination diet may not be safe.
Oral food challenge.During this test, done in a healthcare professional's office, you'll be given small but increasing amounts of the food suspected of causing your symptoms. If you don't have a reaction during this test, you may be able to include this food in your diet again.","One way to avoid an allergic reaction is to avoid the foods that cause symptoms. However, despite your best efforts, you may come into contact with a food that causes a reaction.
For a minor allergic reaction,prescribed antihistamines or those available without a prescription may help reduce symptoms. These drugs can be taken after exposure to an allergy-causing food to help relieve itching or hives. However, antihistamines can't treat a severe allergic reaction.
For a severe allergic reaction,you may need an emergency injection of epinephrine and a trip to the emergency room. Many people with allergies carry an epinephrine autoinjector (Adrenaclick, EpiPen). This device is a combined syringe and concealed needle that injects a single dose of medicine when pressed against your thigh.
If you've been prescribed an epinephrine autoinjector:
Be sure you know how to use the autoinjector.Also, make sure the people closest to you know how to give the drug — if they're with you in an anaphylactic emergency, they could save your life.
Carry it with you at all times.It may be a good idea to keep an extra autoinjector in your car or in your desk at work.
Always be sure to replace epinephrine before its expiration dateor it may not work properly.","A food allergy can be a source of ongoing concern that affects life at home, school and work. Daily activities that are easy for most families, such as grocery shopping and meal preparation, can become occasions of stress for families and caregivers living with food allergies.
Keep these strategies in mind to help manage your or your child's food allergy-related stress:
Connect with others.The opportunity to discuss food allergies and exchange information with others who share your concerns can be very helpful.Many internet sites and nonprofit organizations offer information and forums for discussing food allergies. Some are specifically for parents of children with food allergies. The Food Allergy Research & Education website can direct you to support groups and events in your area.
Educate those around you.Make sure family and caregivers, including babysitters and school staff, have a thorough understanding of your child's food allergy.
Address bullying.Children are sometimes bullied at school because of their food allergies. Discussing your child's allergy with school personnel greatly reduces your child's risk of being a bullying target.","Because appointments can be brief, and because there's often a lot of ground to cover, it's a good idea to be well prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready and what to expect.
Write down any symptoms you've had,including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.
Write down key personal information,including any major stresses or recent life changes.
Make a list of all medicines,vitamins and supplements that you're taking.
Take a family member or friend along,if possible. Sometimes it can be difficult to remember all the information provided to you during an appointment. Someone who accompanies you may recall something that you missed or forgot.
Write down questions to askyour care team.
Your time is limited, so preparing a list of questions will help you make the most of your time together. List your questions from most important to least important in case time runs out. Some basic questions to ask include:
Is my condition likely caused by a food allergy or another reaction?
What kinds of tests do I need?
Is my condition likely temporary or long lasting?
What types of treatment are available, and which do you recommend?
What are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?
I have these other health conditions. How can I best manage these conditions together?
Are there any dietary restrictions that I need to follow?
Should I see a specialist? What will that cost, and will my insurance cover seeing a specialist?
Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing me?
Do you have any printed material that I can take home with me? What websites do you recommend visiting?
If your child is seeing the doctor for a food allergy, you may also want to ask:
Is my child likely to outgrow this allergy?
Are there alternatives to the food or foods that trigger my child's allergy symptoms?
How can I help keep my child with a food allergy safe at school?
In addition to the questions that you've prepared to ask your doctor, don't hesitate to ask questions during your appointment.","One of the keys to preventing an allergic reaction is to completely avoid the food that causes your symptoms.
Don't assume.Always read food labels to make sure they don't contain an ingredient you're allergic to. Even if you think you know what's in a food, check the label. Ingredients sometimes change.Food labels are required to clearly list whether the food products contain any common food allergens. Read food labels carefully to avoid the most common sources of food allergens: milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, soy and wheat.
When in doubt, say no thanks.At restaurants and social gatherings, you're always taking a risk that you might eat a food you're allergic to. Many people don't understand the seriousness of an allergic food reaction and may not realize that a tiny amount of a food can cause a severe reaction in some people.If you have any suspicion at all that a food may contain something you're allergic to, don't eat it.
Involve caregivers.If your child has a food allergy, enlist the help of relatives, babysitters, teachers and other caregivers. Make sure that they understand how important it is for your child to avoid the allergy-causing food and that they know what to do in an emergency.It's also important to let caregivers know what steps they can take to prevent a reaction in the first place, such as careful hand-washing and cleaning any surfaces that might have come in contact with the allergy-causing food."
Latex allergy,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/latex-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20374287,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/latex-allergy/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374291,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/latex-allergy/doctors-departments/ddc-20374292,"Latex allergy is a reaction to certain proteins found in natural rubber latex, a product made from the rubber tree. If you have a latex allergy, your body mistakes latex for a harmful substance.
Latex allergy may cause itchy skin and hives or even anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a possibly life-threatening condition that can cause throat swelling and serious difficulty breathing. A healthcare professional can find out if you have a latex allergy or if you're at risk of developing a latex allergy.
Understanding latex allergy and knowing common sources of latex can help you prevent allergic reactions.","If you're allergic to latex, you're likely to have symptoms after touching latex rubber products, such as gloves or balloons. You also can have symptoms if you breathe in latex particles that are released into the air when someone removes latex gloves.
Latex allergy symptoms range from mild to serious. A reaction depends on how sensitive you are to latex and the amount of latex you touch or inhale. Your reaction can become worse with each additional latex exposure.","Seek emergency medical care if you are having or think you're having an anaphylactic reaction.
If you have less severe reactions after exposure to latex, talk to a healthcare professional. If possible, see a care professional when you're reacting. This will help with diagnosis.","In a latex allergy, the immune system identifies latex as a harmful substance and triggers certain antibodies to fight it off. The next time there is a latex exposure, these antibodies tell the immune system to release histamine and other chemicals into the bloodstream. This process produces a range of allergy symptoms. The more times someone is exposed to latex, the more strongly their immune system is likely to respond. This is called sensitization.
Latex allergy can happen in these ways:
Direct contact.The most common cause of latex allergy involves touching latex-containing products, including latex gloves, condoms and balloons.
Inhalation.Latex products, especially gloves, release latex particles. You can breathe in these particles when they become airborne. The amount of airborne latex from gloves differs greatly depending on the brand of glove used.
It's possible to have other skin reactions when using latex. They include:
Allergic contact dermatitis.This reaction results from the chemical additives used during manufacturing. The main symptom is a skin rash with formation of blisters 24 to 48 hours after exposure, similar to poison ivy.
Irritant contact dermatitis.Not an allergy, this skin irritation is caused by wearing rubber gloves or exposure to the powder inside them. Symptoms include dry, itchy, irritated areas, usually on the hands.
Not all latex products are made from natural sources. Products containing synthetic materials, such as latex paint, are unlikely to cause a reaction.","Certain people are at greater risk of developing a latex allergy:
People with spina bifida.The risk of latex allergy is highest in people with spina bifida — a birth defect that affects the development of the spine. People with this disorder often are exposed to latex products through early and frequent healthcare. People with spina bifida should always avoid latex products.
People who undergo multiple surgeries or medical procedures.Repeated exposure to latex gloves and medical products increases your risk of developing latex allergy.
Healthcare workers.If you work in healthcare, you're at increased risk of developing a latex allergy.
Rubber industry workers.Repeated exposure to latex may increase sensitivity.
People with a personal or family history of allergies.You're at increased risk of latex allergy if you have other allergies — such as hay fever or a food allergy — or they're common in your family.",,,"Diagnosis is sometime a challenge. A healthcare professional typically examines the skin and asks questions about symptoms, medical history and if there have been reactions to latex in the past.
A skin test can help find out if someone's skin reacts to the latex protein. A medical professional uses a tiny needle to place a small amount of latex below the surface of the skin on the forearm or back. If someone is allergic to latex, a raised bump will form. Only an allergist or other healthcare professional experienced in skin testing should perform this test.
Blood tests also may be done to check for latex sensitivity.","Although medicines are available to ease the symptoms of latex allergy, there is no cure. The only way to prevent a latex allergic reaction is to avoid products that contain latex.
Despite your best efforts to avoid latex, you may come into contact with it. If you've had a severe allergic reaction to latex, you may need to always carry injectable epinephrine with you. If you have an anaphylactic reaction, you will need to go to the emergency room for an immediate injection of adrenaline, also known as epinephrine.
For less severe reactions, a care professional may prescribe antihistamines or corticosteroids. These may be taken after exposure to latex to control the reaction and help relieve discomfort.",,"You're likely to start by seeing your family healthcare professional.

It's one of the most common food allergies in children. Cow's milk is the usual cause of milk allergy, but milk from sheep, goats, buffalo and other mammals also can cause a reaction.

An allergic reaction usually occurs soon after you or your child consumes milk. Signs and symptoms of milk allergy range from mild to severe and can include wheezing, vomiting, hives and digestive problems. Milk allergy can also cause anaphylaxis — a severe, life-threatening reaction.

Avoiding milk and milk products is the primary treatment for milk allergy. Fortunately, most children outgrow milk allergy. Those who don't outgrow it may need to continue to avoid milk products.","Milk allergy symptoms, which differ from person to person, occur a few minutes to a few hours after you or your child drinks milk or eats milk products.

Immediate signs and symptoms of milk allergy might include:

Signs and symptoms that may take more time to develop include:","See your provider or an allergist if you or your child experiences milk allergy symptoms shortly after consuming milk. If possible, see your provider during the allergic reaction to help make a diagnosis. Seek emergency treatment if you or your child develops signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis.","All true food allergies are caused by an immune system malfunction.

The next time you come in contact with these proteins, immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies recognize them and signal your immune system to release histamine and other chemicals, causing a range of allergic signs and symptoms.

There are two main proteins in cow's milk that can cause an allergic reaction:

You or your child may be allergic to only one milk protein or to both. These proteins may be hard to avoid because they're also in some processed foods.

If you know you or your child is allergic to milk, avoid milk and milk products.

Read food labels carefully. Look for casein, a milk derivative, which can be found in some unexpected places, such as in some canned tuna, sausage or nondairy products. Question ingredients when ordering in restaurants.","When food causes an allergic reaction, it isn't always easy to find out what food is to blame. To evaluate whether you or your child has milk allergy, your health care provider may:

He or she may also recommend one or both of the following tests:

If your examination and test results can't confirm milk allergy, your health care provider might administer an oral challenge, in which you are fed different foods that may or may not contain milk in increasing amounts to see if you react to the ones that contain milk. It's a good idea to have allergy tests administered by an allergist who's been trained to manage serious reactions.

If your provider suspects that your symptoms are caused by something other than a food allergy, you may need other tests to identify — or rule out — other medical problems.","The only way to prevent an allergic reaction is to avoid milk and milk proteins. This can be difficult because milk is a common ingredient in many foods. Also, some people with milk allergy can tolerate milk in some forms, such as milk that's heated in baked goods, or in some processed foods, such as yogurt. Talk to your health care provider about what to avoid.

If you or your child has a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), you may need an emergency injection of epinephrine (adrenaline) and a trip to the emergency room. If you're at risk of having a severe reaction, you or your child may need to carry injectable epinephrine (EpiPen, Adrenaclick, others) at all times. Have your provider or pharmacist demonstrate how to use this device so that you're prepared for an emergency.","Having a serious allergy or being the parent of a child with a potentially life-threatening allergy can be stressful. Talking to others in similar situations can be helpful. Besides offering support and encouragement, they may also provide useful coping tips, such as how to deal effectively with school officials to ensure your child's medical needs are met. Ask your health care provider if there are any support groups in your area, or contact the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.","You're likely to start by seeing your family health care provider or your child's pediatrician.

Mold allergy,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mold-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20351519,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mold-allergy/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351525,,"If you have a mold allergy, your immune system overreacts when you breathe in mold spores. A mold allergy can cause coughing, itchy eyes and other symptoms that make you miserable. In some people, a mold allergy is linked to asthma and exposure causes restricted breathing and other airway symptoms.

If you have a mold allergy, the best defense is to reduce your exposure to the types of mold that cause your reaction. Medications can help keep mold allergy reactions under control.","A mold allergy causes the same signs and symptoms that occur in other types of upper respiratory allergies. Signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis caused by a mold allergy can include:

Mold allergy symptoms vary from person to person and range from mild to severe. You might have year-round symptoms or symptoms that flare up only during certain times of the year. You might notice symptoms when the weather is damp or when you're in indoor or outdoor spaces that have high concentrations of mold.","If you have a stuffy nose, sneezing, watery eyes, shortness of breath, wheezing or other bothersome symptoms that persist, see your doctor.","Like any allergy, mold allergy symptoms are triggered by an overly sensitive immune system response. When you inhale tiny, airborne mold spores, your body recognizes them as foreign invaders and develops allergy-causing antibodies to fight them.

Exposure to mold spores can cause a reaction right away, or the reaction can be delayed.

Various molds are common indoors and outdoors. Only certain kinds of mold cause allergies. Being allergic to one type of mold doesn't mean you'll be allergic to another. Some of the most common molds that cause allergies include alternaria, aspergillus, cladosporium and penicillium.","A number of factors can make you more likely to develop a mold allergy or worsen your mold allergy symptoms, including:

Living in a house with high humidity.Having indoor humidity higher than 50% can increase mold in your home.

Mold can grow virtually anywhere if the conditions are right — in basements, behind walls in framing, on soap-coated grout and other damp surfaces, in carpet pads, and in the carpet itself. Exposure to high levels of household mold can trigger mold allergy symptoms.","Most allergic responses to mold involve hay fever-type symptoms that can make you miserable but aren't serious. However, certain allergic conditions caused by mold are more severe. These include:","To reduce mold growth in your home, consider these tips:","Besides considering your signs and symptoms, your doctor might conduct a physical examination to identify or exclude other medical problems. Tests used to identify an allergy include:","The best way to manage an allergy is to avoid exposure to triggers. However, molds are common, and you can't completely avoid them.

While there's no sure way to cure allergic rhinitis caused by a mold allergy, a number of medications can ease your symptoms. These include:

Nasal corticosteroids.These nasal sprays help prevent and treat the inflammation caused by an upper respiratory mold allergy. For many people, they're the most effective allergy medications, and they're often the first medication prescribed.

Examples include ciclesonide (Omnaris, Zetonna), fluticasone (Flonase Allergy Relief, Xhance), mometasone (Nasonex), triamcinolone and budesonide (Rhinocort). Nosebleeds and nasal dryness are the most common side effects of these medications, which are generally safe for long-term use.

Antihistamines.These medications can help with itching, sneezing and runny nose. They work by blocking histamine, an inflammatory chemical released by your immune system during an allergic reaction.

Over-the-counter (OTC) antihistamines include loratadine (Alavert, Claritin), fexofenadine (Allegra Allergy) and cetirizine (Zyrtec Allergy). They cause little to no drowsiness or dry mouth.

The nasal sprays azelastine (Astelin, Astepro) and olopatadine (Patanase) are available by prescription. Side effects of the nasal sprays can include a bitter taste in your mouth and nasal dryness.

Montelukast.Montelukast (Singulair) is a tablet taken to block the action of leukotrienes — immune system chemicals that cause allergy symptoms such as excess mucus. However, concerns about side effects, including anxiety, insomnia, depression and suicidal thinking, are increasing. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently put a warning on the box about the drug's use.

Like antihistamines, this medication is not as effective as inhaled corticosteroids. It has been used when nasal sprays cannot be tolerated or when mild asthma is present.

Other treatments for mold allergy include:

Nasal lavage.To help with irritating nasal symptoms, your doctor might recommend that you rinse your nose daily with salt water. Use a specially designed squeeze bottle, such as the one included in saline kits (Sinus Rinse, others), bulb syringe or neti pot to irrigate your nasal passages. This home remedy, called nasal lavage, can help keep your nose free of irritants.

Use water that's distilled, sterile, previously boiled and cooled, or filtered using a filter with an absolute pore size of 1 micron or smaller to make up the irrigation solution. Be sure to rinse the irrigation device after each use with similarly distilled, sterile, previously boiled and cooled, or filtered water and leave open to air-dry.",,"Many people are diagnosed and treated for allergies by their primary care physicians. However, depending on the severity of your allergies, your primary care doctor might refer you to a doctor who specializes in treating allergies.

Nickel allergy,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nickel-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20351529,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nickel-allergy/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351534,,"Nickel allergy is a common cause of allergic contact dermatitis — an itchy rash that appears where your skin touches a usually harmless substance.

Nickel allergy is often associated with earrings and other jewelry. But nickel can be found in many everyday items, such as coins, zippers, eyeglass frames, cosmetics, detergents, and even some electronics, including cellphones and laptops.

It may take repeated or prolonged exposure to items containing nickel to develop a nickel allergy. Treatments can reduce the symptoms of nickel allergy. Once you develop a nickel allergy, however, you'll always be sensitive to the metal and need to avoid contact.","An allergic reaction (contact dermatitis) usually begins within hours to days after exposure to nickel. The reaction may last as long as 2 to 4 weeks. The reaction tends to occur only where your skin came into contact with nickel, but sometimes may appear in other places on your body.

Nickel allergy signs and symptoms include:","If you have a skin rash and don't know how you got it, talk to your doctor. If you've already been diagnosed with nickel allergy and are sure you're reacting to nickel exposure, use the over-the-counter treatments and home remedies your doctor has previously recommended.

However, if these treatments don't help, call your doctor. If you think the area may have become infected, see your doctor right away. Signs and symptoms that might indicate an infection include:","The exact cause of nickel allergy is unknown. As with other allergies, nickel allergy develops when your immune system views nickel as a harmful, rather than harmless substance. Normally, your immune system only reacts to protect your body against bacteria, viruses or toxic substances.

Once your body has developed a reaction to a particular agent (allergen) — in this case, nickel — your immune system will always be sensitive to it. That means anytime you come into contact with nickel, your immune system will respond and produce an allergic response.

Your immune system's sensitivity to nickel may develop after your first exposure or after repeated or prolonged exposure.","Certain factors may increase your risk of developing nickel allergy, including:

Working with metal.If you work in an occupation that constantly exposes you to nickel, your risk of developing an allergy may be higher than it is for someone who doesn't work with the metal.

In addition, people who have regular exposure to nickel while doing ""wet work"" — as a result of either sweat or frequent contact with water — may be more likely to develop nickel allergy. These people may include bartenders, people who work in certain food industries and domestic cleaners.

Other people who may have an increased risk of nickel allergy include metalworkers, tailors and hairdressers.",,"The best strategy to prevent a nickel allergy from developing is to avoid prolonged exposure to items containing nickel. If you already have a nickel allergy, the best way to prevent an allergic reaction is to avoid contact with the metal.

However, it's not always easy to avoid nickel because it's present in so many products. Home test kits are available to check for nickel in metal items.

The following tips may help you avoid nickel exposure:","Your doctor can usually diagnose nickel allergy based on your skin's appearance, and a recent exposure to items that may contain nickel.

If the cause of your rash isn't apparent, however, your doctor may recommend a patch test (contact hypersensitivity allergy test). He or she may refer you to an allergy specialist (allergist) or a skin specialist (dermatologist) for this test.","The first step in treating nickel allergy is avoiding contact with the metal. There's no cure for nickel allergy. Once you develop a sensitivity to nickel, you'll develop a rash (contact dermatitis) whenever you come into contact with the metal.",,You're likely to see your family doctor first if you're experiencing an itchy rash that may be related to nickel allergy.

Peanut allergy,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peanut-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20376175,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peanut-allergy/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20376181,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peanut-allergy/doctors-departments/ddc-20376182,"Peanut allergy is a condition that causes the body's germ-fighting immune system to react to peanuts. It's one of the most common causes of a life-threatening allergic reaction to food. This life-threatening reaction is known as anaphylaxis.
Peanut allergy has been increasing in children. Even if you or your child has shown only a mild reaction to peanuts, it's important to talk to a healthcare professional. There is still a risk of a more serious future reaction.","An allergic response to peanuts usually occurs within minutes after exposure. Peanut allergy signs and symptoms can include:
Skin reactions, such as hives, redness or swelling.
Itching or tingling in or around the mouth and throat.
Digestive problems, such as diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea or vomiting.
Tightening of the throat.
Shortness of breath or wheezing.
Runny nose.","Talk to your care team if you have had any signs or symptoms of peanut allergy. Seek emergency treatment if you have a severe reaction to peanuts.
Call, or have someone else call 911 or your local emergency number if you have any signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis such as:
Severe dizziness.
Severe trouble breathing.
Loss of consciousness.","Peanut allergy occurs when the immune system flags peanut proteins as harmful. When exposed to peanuts, the immune system releases symptom-causing chemicals into the bloodstream. These chemicals cause an allergic reaction.
Direct and cross-contact with peanuts could cause a reaction:
Direct contact.The most common cause of peanut allergy is eating peanuts or foods that contain peanuts.
Cross-contact.This happens when peanuts get into a product by mistake. It often happens when food is exposed to peanuts during processing or handling.
Inhalation.Breathing in dust or aerosols containing peanuts, such as peanut flour, may cause an allergic reaction.","It isn't clear why some people develop allergies while others don't. However, people with certain risk factors have a greater chance of developing peanut allergy.
Peanut allergy risk factors include:
Age.Food allergies are most common in children, especially toddlers and infants. As a person grows, the digestive system matures. Then the body is less likely to react to food that triggers allergies.
Past allergy to peanuts.Some children with peanut allergy outgrow it, though it can recur. So be cautious even if you seem to have outgrown peanut allergy.
Other allergies.If you're already allergic to one food, you have a higher risk of being allergic to another. Also, having another type of allergy, such as hay fever, raises your risk of having a food allergy.
Family members with allergies.Your risk of peanut allergy is higher if other allergies are common in your family, especially other food allergies.
Atopic dermatitis.Some people with the skin condition atopic dermatitis, also called eczema, have a food allergy as well.",Complications of peanut allergy can include anaphylaxis. Children and adults who have a severe peanut allergy are especially at risk of having this life-threatening reaction.,"Studies have shown a strong link between early peanut exposure and lower food allergy risk. In the studies, peanuts were introduced to high-risk babies and children from 4 months to 3 years old. By doing so, their food allergy risk was reduced up to 80%. Children at risk of peanut allergy include those with mild to severe eczema, egg allergy, or both. Before introducing your child to peanuts, discuss the best approach with your child's healthcare professional.","Talking with your healthcare team about your symptoms and medical history starts the process of diagnosis. A physical exam usually follows and these next steps may be needed:
Food diary.Your care team may ask you to keep a food diary of your eating habits, symptoms and medicines.
Skin test.A small amount of food or other substance is placed on your skin. Then, your skin is pricked with a needle. If you're allergic to that substance, you'll develop a raised bump or reaction.
Blood test.A blood test can measure your immune system's response to certain foods. It checks the amount of allergy-type antibodies in your bloodstream, also known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies.
Elimination diet.Your team may suggest an elimination diet if you could be allergic to more foods in addition to peanuts. You might be asked to stop eating peanuts or other suspect foods for a week or two. Then, you'll add the food items back into your diet one at a time. This process can help link symptoms to certain foods. If you've had a severe reaction to foods, this method can't safely be used.
All these sources may help confirm a peanut allergy. Or they may point to another cause such as food intolerance.","The standard approach to care for peanut allergy is to avoid foods that contain peanuts. Yet researchers continue to study different therapies that will lessen the chance of severe reactions, including anaphylaxis.","If your child has peanut allergy, take these steps to help keep your child safe:
Involve caregivers.Ask relatives, babysitters, teachers and other caregivers to help. Teach the adults who spend time with your child how to recognize signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction to peanuts. Emphasize that an allergic reaction can be life-threatening and requires immediate action.Also, make sure that your child knows to ask for help right away in case of an allergic reaction.
Use a written plan.Write down the steps to take in case of an allergic reaction. Include the order and doses of all medicines to be given. List contact information for family members and healthcare providers. Give a copy of the plan to family members, teachers and others who care for your child.
Discourage your child from sharing foods.It's common for kids to share snacks and treats. However, while playing, your child may forget about food allergies or sensitivities. If your child is allergic to peanuts, encourage your child not to eat food from others.
Make sure your child's epinephrine autoinjector is always available.An injection of epinephrine needs to be given right away to reduce the chance of anaphylaxis. Make sure caregivers and family members know about your child's emergency medicine. They should know where the autoinjector is located, when it may be needed and how to use it.
Make sure your child's school has a food allergy management plan.Guidelines are available to create policies and procedures. Staff should have access to an epinephrine injector and be trained how to use it.
Have your child wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace.This will help your child get the right treatment if communication isn't possible during a severe reaction. The alert will include your child's name and the type of food allergy. Also, it may list brief emergency instructions.
If you have peanut allergy,do the following:
Always carry your epinephrine autoinjector.
Wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace.","To get the most from your appointment, it's a good idea to be well prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment and know what to.
Describe your symptoms.Be ready to tell your doctor what happened after you ate peanuts or food that contains peanuts. Note how long it took for a reaction to occur. Try to recall how many peanuts you ate. Or how much you ate of a peanut-containing food that triggered your symptoms.
Make a list of all the medicines you're taking.Include vitamins or supplements.
Take a family member or friend along.Sometimes it can be difficult to recall all the information provided to you during an appointment. If someone can join you, that person may remember something that you missed or forgot.
Write down any questions you have.
Some basic questions to ask include:
Are my symptoms likely caused by peanut allergy?
What else might be causing my symptoms?
What tests do I need?
What's the best treatment?
Should I see a specialist?
Is there a generic version of the medicine you're prescribing?
Are there brochures or other printed material that I can take with me? What websites do you recommend?
Do I need to carry an epinephrine autoinjector?
If your child is seeing a healthcare professional for a peanut allergy, you also may want to ask:
Are there alternatives to the foods that trigger my child's allergy symptoms?
How can I help keep my child with peanut allergy safe at school?
Is my child likely to outgrow his or her allergy?
Don't hesitate to ask any other questions.","One of the keys to preventing an allergic reaction is knowing how to avoid the food that causes your symptoms. Follow these steps:
Never assume that a food doesn't contain peanuts.Peanuts may be in foods that surprise you. Always read labels on processed foods to make sure they don't contain peanuts or peanut products. Processed foods are required to clearly state if foods contain any peanuts. Also, labels must state if foods were produced in factories that process peanuts.Even if you think that you know what's in a food, check the label. Ingredients may change.
Don't ignore a label that says a food was produced in a factory that processes peanuts.Most people with a peanut allergy need to avoid all products that could contain peanuts, even trace amounts.
When in doubt, say ""no thanks.""At restaurants and social gatherings, there's always a risk of eating peanuts by accident. Many people don't understand how serious an allergic food reaction is. They may not know that a tiny amount of a food can cause a severe reaction. If you are at all worried that a food may contain something you're allergic to, don't try it.
Be prepared for a reaction.Talk with your doctor about carrying emergency medicines in case of a severe reaction."
Penicillin allergy,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/penicillin-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20376222,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/penicillin-allergy/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20376226,,"Penicillin allergy is an abnormal reaction of your immune system to the antibiotic drug penicillin. Penicillin is prescribed for treating various bacterial infections.

Common signs and symptoms of penicillin allergy include hives, rash and itching. Severe reactions include anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition that affects multiple body systems.

Research has shown that penicillin allergies may be over-reported — a problem that can result in the use of less-appropriate and more-expensive antibiotic treatments. Therefore, an accurate diagnosis is needed when penicillin allergy is suspected to ensure the best treatment options in the future.

Other antibiotics, particularly those with chemical properties similar to penicillin, also can result in allergic reactions.","Signs and symptoms of penicillin allergy often occur within an hour after taking the drug. Less commonly, reactions can occur hours, days or weeks later.

Penicillin allergy signs and symptoms may include:","See your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs or symptoms of penicillin allergy. It's important to understand and discuss what is an allergic reaction, what is a typical side effect and what you can tolerate in taking a medication.

Call 911 or emergency medical help if you experience signs of a severe reaction or suspected anaphylaxis after taking penicillin.","Penicillin allergy occurs when your immune system becomes hypersensitive to the drug — mistakenly reacting to the drug as a harmful substance, as if it were a viral or bacterial infection.

Before the immune system can become sensitive to penicillin, you have to be exposed to the medication at least once. If and when your immune system misidentifies penicillin as a harmful substance, it develops an antibody to the drug.

The next time you take the drug, these specific antibodies flag it and direct immune system attacks on the substance. Chemicals released by this activity cause the signs and symptoms associated with an allergic reaction.

Previous exposure to penicillin may not be obvious. Some evidence suggests that trace amounts of it in the food supply may be sufficient for a person's immune system to create an antibody to it.","While anyone can have an allergic reaction to penicillin, a few factors can increase your risk. These include:",,"If you have a penicillin allergy, the simplest prevention is to avoid the drug. Steps you can take to protect yourself include the following:","A thorough exam and appropriate diagnostic tests are essential for an accurate diagnosis. A misdiagnosed penicillin allergy may result in the use of less-appropriate or more-expensive antibiotics.

Your doctor will conduct a physical examination, ask questions about your symptoms and order additional tests. You may be referred to an allergy specialist (allergist) for these tests. These may include the following.",Interventions for a penicillin allergy can be divided into two general strategies:,,"Be prepared to answer the following questions. These details will be important in helping your doctor determine the cause of your symptoms.

Pet allergy,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pet-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20352192,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pet-allergy/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352198,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pet-allergy/doctors-departments/ddc-20352200,"Pet allergy is an allergic reaction to proteins found in an animal's skin cells, saliva or urine. Signs of pet allergy include those common to hay fever, such as sneezing and runny nose. Some people may also experience signs of asthma, such as wheezing and difficulty breathing.

Most often, pet allergy is triggered by exposure to the dead flakes of skin (dander) a pet sheds. Any animal with fur can be a source of pet allergy, but pet allergies are most commonly associated with cats and dogs.

If you have a pet allergy, the best strategy is to avoid or reduce exposure to the animal as much as possible. Medications or other treatments may be necessary to relieve symptoms and manage asthma.","Pet allergy signs and symptoms caused by inflammation of nasal passages include:

If your pet allergy contributes to asthma, you may also experience:","Some signs and symptoms of pet allergy, such as a runny nose or sneezing, are similar to those of the common cold. Sometimes it's difficult to know whether you have a cold or an allergy. If symptoms persist for more than two weeks, you might have an allergy.

If your signs and symptoms are severe — with nasal passages feeling completely blocked and difficulty sleeping or wheezing — call your doctor. Seek emergency care if wheezing or shortness of breath rapidly worsens or if you are short of breath with minimal activity.","Allergies occur when your immune system reacts to a foreign substance such as pollen, mold or pet dander.

Your immune system produces proteins known as antibodies. These antibodies protect you from unwanted invaders that could make you sick or cause an infection. When you have allergies, your immune system makes antibodies that identify your particular allergen as something harmful, even though it isn't.

When you inhale the allergen or come into contact with it, your immune system responds and produces an inflammatory response in your nasal passages or lungs. Prolonged or regular exposure to the allergen can cause the ongoing (chronic) airway inflammation associated with asthma.","Pet allergies are common. However, you're more likely to develop a pet allergy if allergies or asthma runs in your family.

Being exposed to pets at an early age may help you avoid pet allergies. Some studies have found that children who live with a dog in the first year of life may have better resistance to upper respiratory infections during childhood than kids who don't have a dog at that age.","Ongoing (chronic) inflammation of tissues in the nasal passages caused by pet allergy can obstruct the hollow cavities connected to your nasal passages (sinuses). These obstructions may make you more likely to develop bacterial infections of the sinuses, such as sinusitis.","If you don't have a pet but are considering adopting or buying one, make sure you don't have pet allergies before making the commitment.","Your doctor may suspect a pet allergy based on symptoms, an examination of your nose, and your answers to his or her questions. He or she may use a lighted instrument to look at the condition of the lining of your nose. If you have a pet allergy, the lining of the nasal passage may be swollen or appear pale or bluish.","The first line of treatment for controlling pet allergy is avoiding the allergy-causing animal as much as possible. When you minimize your exposure to pet allergens, you generally should expect to have allergic reactions that are less often or less severe.

It's often difficult or impossible to eliminate completely your exposure to animal allergens. Even if you don't have a pet, you may unexpectedly encounter pet allergens transported on other people's clothes.

In addition to avoiding pet allergens, you may need medications to control symptoms.",,"If you're experiencing runny nose, sneezing, wheezing, shortness of breath or other symptoms that may be related to an allergy, you'll most likely start by seeing your family doctor. Because appointments can be brief, and because there's often a lot of ground to cover, it's a good idea to prepare for your appointment.",

Marine animals in the shellfish category include crustaceans and mollusks. Examples are shrimp, crabs, lobster, squid, oysters, scallops and snails.
Shellfish is a common food allergy. Some people with shellfish allergy react to all shellfish, while others react to only certain kinds. Reactions range from mild symptoms — such as hives or a stuffy nose — to severe and even life-threatening.
If you think you have shellfish allergy, talk to your health care provider. Tests can help confirm the allergy so you can take steps to avoid future reactions.","Shellfish allergy symptoms generally start within minutes to an hour after eating or having contact with shellfish. They may include:
Hives
Itchy, irritated skin
Nasal stuffiness (congestion)
Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other parts of the body
Wheezing or trouble breathing
Coughing and choking or a tight feeling in the throat
Belly (abdominal) pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting
Dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting","Seek emergency treatment if you develop signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis.
See a health care provider or allergy specialist if you have food allergy symptoms shortly after eating.","All food allergies are caused by an immune system overreaction. Your immune system identifies a harmless substance as being harmful. This substance is called an allergen. In shellfish allergy, your immune system mistakenly identifies a certain protein in shellfish as harmful. Your immune system is how your body protects itself, so it produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against this allergen. The next time you come in contact with the shellfish protein, these antibodies signal your immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into your bloodstream. This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of an allergic reaction.","You're at increased risk of developing shellfish allergy if allergies of any type are common in your family.
Though people of any age can develop shellfish allergy, it's more common in adults. In fact, shellfish allergy is the most common food allergy in adults. Among adults, shellfish allergy is more common in women. Among children, shellfish allergy is more common in boys.","In severe cases, shellfish allergy can lead to anaphylaxis, a dangerous allergic reaction that can be life-threatening.
When you have shellfish allergy, you may be at increased risk of anaphylaxis if you have:
Asthma
Allergic reactions to very small amounts of shellfish (extreme sensitivity)
History of food-induced anaphylaxis
Strong family history of allergy
Anaphylaxis is treated with an emergency injection of epinephrine (adrenaline). If you are at risk of having a severe allergic reaction to shellfish, you always should carry injectable epinephrine (Auvi-Q, EpiPen, others).","If you have shellfish allergy, the only way to avoid an allergic reaction is to avoid all shellfish and products that contain shellfish. Even trace amounts of shellfish can cause a severe reaction in some people.","To find out if you have shellfish allergy, your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and do a physical exam to find or rule out other medical problems.
A history of allergic reactions shortly after exposure to shellfish can be a sign of shellfish allergy. But the symptoms could also be caused by something else, such as food poisoning.
Allergy testing is the only sure way to tell what's causing your symptoms, so your provider may recommend one or both of these tests:
Skin prick test.Small amounts of the proteins found in shellfish are pricked into skin on your arm or upper back. You're then watched for an allergic reaction. If you're allergic, you'll develop a raised bump (hive) at the test site on your skin. This typically takes about 15 to 20 minutes. Allergy specialists usually are best equipped to perform allergy skin tests.
Blood test.A blood sample is sent to a lab to measure your immune system's response to a specific allergen. This test measures your immune system's response to shellfish proteins by measuring the amount of allergy-causing antibodies in your bloodstream, known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies.
Medically supervised food challenges can be performed if the diagnosis still isn't clear after allergy testing.","The only sure way to prevent an allergic reaction to shellfish is to avoid shellfish. But despite your best efforts, you may come into contact with shellfish.
If you have a severe allergic reaction to shellfish (anaphylaxis), you'll likely need an emergency injection of epinephrine (adrenaline). If you're at risk of anaphylaxis to shellfish, your health care provider can give you a prescription in advance and explain how and when to give the injection. Regularly check the expiration date on the packaging to make sure it's current.
Carry injectable epinephrine (Auvi-Q, EpiPen, others) with you at all times. Epinephrine is typically given at the first sign of an allergic reaction. A second dose may be needed if symptoms recur. After you use epinephrine, seek emergency medical care, even if you start to feel better.",,You're likely to start by seeing your family health care provider.

Allergic reactions can be caused by eating wheat and also, in some cases, by inhaling wheat flour.

Avoiding wheat is the primary treatment for wheat allergy, but that isn't always as easy as it sounds. Wheat is found in many foods, including some you might not suspect, such as soy sauce, ice cream and hot dogs. Medications may be necessary to manage allergic reactions if you accidentally eat wheat.

Wheat allergy sometimes is confused with celiac disease, but these conditions differ. Wheat allergy occurs when your body produces antibodies to proteins found in wheat. In celiac disease, a specific protein in wheat — gluten — causes a different kind of abnormal immune system reaction.",A child or adult with wheat allergy is likely to develop signs and symptoms within minutes to hours after eating something containing wheat. Wheat allergy signs and symptoms include:,"If someone shows signs of anaphylaxis, call 911 or your local emergency number. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency that requires immediate care.

If you suspect that you or your child is allergic to wheat or another food, see your doctor.","If you have wheat allergy, exposure to a wheat protein primes your immune system for an allergic reaction. You can develop an allergy to any of the four classes of wheat proteins — albumin, globulin, gliadin and gluten.",Certain factors may put you at greater risk of developing wheat allergy:,,,"A physical exam, detailed medical history and some tests will help your doctor make a diagnosis. Tests or diagnostic tools may include:

Skin test.Tiny drops of purified allergen extracts — including extracts for wheat proteins — are pricked onto your skin's surface, either on your forearm or on your upper back. After 15 minutes, your doctor or nurse looks for signs of allergic reactions.

If you develop a red, itchy bump where the wheat protein extract was pricked onto your skin, you may be allergic to wheat. The most common side effect of these skin tests is itching and redness.","Avoiding wheat proteins is the best treatment for wheat allergy.

Hair loss,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hair-loss/symptoms-causes/syc-20372926,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hair-loss/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20372932,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hair-loss/doctors-departments/ddc-20372934,"Hair loss (alopecia) can affect just your scalp or your entire body, and it can be temporary or permanent. It can be the result of heredity, hormonal changes, medical conditions or a normal part of aging. Anyone can lose hair on their head, but it's more common in men.
Baldness typically refers to excessive hair loss from your scalp. Hereditary hair loss with age is the most common cause of baldness. Some people prefer to let their hair loss run its course untreated and unhidden. Others may cover it up with hairstyles, makeup, hats or scarves. And still others choose one of the treatments available to prevent further hair loss or restore growth.
Before pursuing hair loss treatment, talk with your doctor about the cause of your hair loss and treatment options.","Hair loss can appear in many different ways, depending on what's causing it. It can come on suddenly or gradually and affect just your scalp or your whole body.
Signs and symptoms of hair loss may include:
Gradual thinning on top of head.This is the most common type of hair loss, affecting people as they age. In men, hair often begins to recede at the hairline on the forehead. Women typically have a broadening of the part in their hair. An increasingly common hair loss pattern in older women is a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia).
Circular or patchy bald spots.Some people lose hair in circular or patchy bald spots on the scalp, beard or eyebrows. Your skin may become itchy or painful before the hair falls out.
Sudden loosening of hair.A physical or emotional shock can cause hair to loosen. Handfuls of hair may come out when combing or washing your hair or even after gentle tugging. This type of hair loss usually causes overall hair thinning but is temporary.
Full-body hair loss.Some conditions and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer, can result in the loss of hair all over your body. The hair usually grows back.
Patches of scaling that spread over the scalp.This is a sign of ringworm. It may be accompanied by broken hair, redness, swelling and, at times, oozing.","See your doctor if you are distressed by persistent hair loss in you or your child and want to pursue treatment. For women who are experiencing a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia), talk with your doctor about early treatment to avoid significant permanent baldness.
Also talk to your doctor if you notice sudden or patchy hair loss or more than usual hair loss when combing or washing your or your child's hair. Sudden hair loss can signal an underlying medical condition that requires treatment.","People typically lose 50 to 100 hairs a day. This usually isn't noticeable because new hair is growing in at the same time. Hair loss occurs when new hair doesn't replace the hair that has fallen out.
Hair loss is typically related to one or more of the following factors:
Family history (heredity).The most common cause of hair loss is a hereditary condition that happens with aging. This condition is called androgenic alopecia, male-pattern baldness and female-pattern baldness. It usually occurs gradually and in predictable patterns — a receding hairline and bald spots in men and thinning hair along the crown of the scalp in women.
Hormonal changes and medical conditions.A variety of conditions can cause permanent or temporary hair loss, including hormonal changes due to pregnancy, childbirth, menopause and thyroid problems. Medical conditions include alopecia areata (al-o-PEE-she-uh ar-e-A-tuh), which is immune system related and causes patchy hair loss, scalp infections such as ringworm, and a hair-pulling disorder called trichotillomania (trik-o-til-o-MAY-nee-uh).
Medications and supplements.Hair loss can be a side effect of certain drugs, such as those used for cancer, arthritis, depression, heart problems, gout and high blood pressure.
Radiation therapy to the head.The hair may not grow back the same as it was before.
A very stressful event.Many people experience a general thinning of hair several months after a physical or emotional shock. This type of hair loss is temporary.
Hairstyles and treatments.Excessive hairstyling or hairstyles that pull your hair tight, such as pigtails or cornrows, can cause a type of hair loss called traction alopecia. Hot-oil hair treatments and permanents also can cause hair to fall out. If scarring occurs, hair loss could be permanent.","A number of factors can increase your risk of hair loss, including:
A family history of balding on your mother's or father's side
Age
Significant weight loss
Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes and lupus
Stress
Poor nutrition",,"Most baldness is caused by genetics (male-pattern baldness and female-pattern baldness). This type of hair loss is not preventable.
These tips may help you avoid preventable types of hair loss:
Be gentle with your hair. Use a detangler and avoid tugging when brushing and combing, especially when your hair is wet. A wide-toothed comb might help prevent pulling out hair. Avoid harsh treatments such as hot rollers, curling irons, hot-oil treatments and permanents. Limit the tension on hair from styles that use rubber bands, barrettes and braids.
Ask your doctor about medications and supplements you take that might cause hair loss.
Protect your hair from sunlight and other sources of ultraviolet light.
Stop smoking. Some studies show an association between smoking and baldness in men.
If you're being treated with chemotherapy, ask your doctor about a cooling cap. This cap can reduce your risk of losing hair during chemotherapy.","Before making a diagnosis, your doctor will likely give you a physical exam and ask about your diet, your hair care routine, and your medical and family history. You might also have tests, such as the following:
Blood test.This might help uncover medical conditions that can cause hair loss.
Pull test.Your doctor gently pulls several dozen hairs to see how many come out. This helps determine the stage of the shedding process.
Scalp biopsy.Your doctor scrapes samples from the skin or from a few hairs plucked from the scalp to examine the hair roots under a microscope. This can help determine whether an infection is causing hair loss.
Light microscopy.Your doctor uses a special instrument to examine hairs trimmed at their bases. Microscopy helps uncover possible disorders of the hair shaft.","Effective treatments for some types of hair loss are available. You might be able to reverse hair loss, or at least slow it. With some conditions, such as patchy hair loss (alopecia areata), hair may regrow without treatment within a year. Treatments for hair loss include medications and surgery.",,You're likely to first bring your concerns to the attention of your family doctor. He or she may refer you to a doctor who specializes in the treatment of skin problems (dermatologist).,"You might want to try various hair care methods to find one that makes you feel better about how you look. For example, use styling products that add volume, color your hair, choose a hairstyle that makes a widening part less noticeable. Use wigs or extensions, or shave your head. Talk with a hair stylist for ideas. These approaches can be used to address permanent or temporary hair loss.
If your hair loss is due to a medical condition, the cost of a wig might be covered by insurance."
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354022,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354027,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/doctors-departments/ddc-20354029,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (a-my-o-TROE-fik LAT-ur-ul skluh-ROE-sis), known as ALS, is a nervous system disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.ALScauses loss of muscle control. The disease gets worse over time.
ALSis often called Lou Gehrig's disease after the baseball player who was diagnosed with it. The exact cause of the disease is still not known. A small number of cases are inherited.
ALSoften begins with muscle twitching and weakness in an arm or leg, trouble swallowing or slurred speech. EventuallyALSaffects control of the muscles needed to move, speak, eat and breathe. There is no cure for this fatal disease.","Symptoms ofALSvary from person to person. Symptoms depend on which nerve cells are affected.ALSgenerally begins with muscle weakness that spreads and gets worse over time. Symptoms might include:
Trouble walking or doing usual daily activities.
Tripping and falling.
Weakness in the legs, feet or ankles.
Hand weakness or clumsiness.
Slurred speech or trouble swallowing.
Weakness associated with muscle cramps and twitching in the arms, shoulders and tongue.
Untimely crying, laughing or yawning.
Thinking or behavioral changes.
ALSoften starts in the hands, feet, arms or legs. Then it spreads to other parts of the body. Muscles get weaker as more nerve cells die. This eventually affects chewing, swallowing, speaking and breathing.
There's generally no pain in the early stages ofALS. Pain also is not common in the later stages.ALSdoesn't usually affect bladder control. It also usually doesn't affect the senses, including the ability to taste, smell, touch and hear.",,"ALSaffects the nerve cells that control voluntary muscle movements such as walking and talking. These nerve cells are called motor neurons. There are two groups of motor neurons. The first group extends from the brain to the spinal cord to muscles throughout the body. They're referred to as upper motor neurons. The second group extends from the spinal cord to muscles throughout the body. They're referred to as lower motor neurons.
ALScauses both groups of motor neurons to gradually deteriorate and then die. When motor neurons are damaged, they stop sending messages to the muscles. As a result, the muscles can't function.
For about 10% of people withALS, a genetic cause can be identified. For the rest, the cause is not known.
Researchers continue to study possible causes ofALS. Most theories center on a complex interaction between genes and factors in the environment.","Established risk factors forALSinclude:
Genetics.For about 10% of people withALS, a risk gene was passed down from a family member. This is called hereditaryALS. In most people with hereditaryALS, their children have a 50% chance of inheriting the gene.
Age.Risk increases with age up to age 75.ALSis most common between the ages of 60 and the mid-80s.
Sex.Before the age of 65, slightly more men than women developALS. This sex difference disappears after age 70.
Environmental factors, such as the following, have been associated with an increased risk ofALS.
Smoking.Evidence supports that smoking is an environmental risk factor forALS. Women who smoke seem to be at even higher risk, particularly after menopause.
Environmental toxin exposure.Some evidence suggests that exposure to lead or other substances in the workplace or at home might be linked toALS. Much study has been done, but no one agent or chemical has been consistently associated withALS.
Military service.Studies indicate that people who have served in the military are at higher risk ofALS. It's not clear what about military service might triggerALS. It might include exposure to certain metals or chemicals, traumatic injuries, viral infections, or intense exertion.","As the disease progresses,ALScauses complications, such as:",,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known asALS, can be hard to diagnose early because it can have symptoms similar to other diseases. Tests to rule out other conditions or help diagnoseALSmight include:
Electromyogram (EMG).A needle is inserted through the skin into various muscles. The test records the electrical activity of the muscles when they contract and when they're at rest. This can determine if there is a problem with the muscles or nerves.
Nerve conduction study.This study measures your nerves' ability to send impulses to muscles in different areas of the body. This test can determine if you have nerve damage.EMGand nerve conduction studies are almost always done together.
MRI.Using radio waves and a powerful magnetic field, anMRIproduces detailed images of the brain and spinal cord. AnMRIcan reveal spinal cord tumors, herniated disks in the neck or other conditions that might be causing your symptoms. The highest resolution cameras may sometimes seeALSchanges themselves.
Blood and urine tests.Analyzing samples of your blood and urine in the laboratory might help eliminate other possible causes of your symptoms. Serum neurofilament light levels, which are measured from blood samples, are generally high in people withALS. The test can help make a diagnosis early in the disease.
Spinal tap, known as a lumbar puncture.This involves removing a sample of spinal fluid for laboratory testing. Spinal fluid is removed using a small needle inserted between two bones in the lower back. The spinal fluid appears typical in people withALSbut may uncover another cause of symptoms.
Muscle biopsy.If your health care provider believes you may have a muscle disease rather thanALS, you might undergo a muscle biopsy. While you're under local anesthesia, a small piece of muscle is removed and sent to a lab for analysis.
Nerve biopsy.If your health care provider believes you may have a nerve disease rather thanALS, you might undergo a nerve biopsy. While you're under local anesthesia, a small piece of nerve is removed and sent to a lab for analysis.","Treatments can't reverse the damage ofALS, but they can slow the progression of symptoms. They also can help prevent complications and make you more comfortable and independent.
You might need a team of health care providers and doctors trained in many areas to provide your care. The team works together to prolong your survival and improve your quality of life.
Your team works to select the right treatments for you. You have the right to choose or refuse any of the treatments suggested.","Learning you haveALScan be devastating. The following tips may help you and your family cope:
Take time to grieve.The news that you have a fatal condition that reduces your mobility and independence is hard to hear. You and your family may go through a period of mourning and grief after diagnosis.
Be hopeful.Your team can help you focus on your abilities and healthy living. Some people withALSlive much longer than the 3 to 5 years usually associated with this condition. Some live 10 years or more. Maintaining an optimistic outlook can help improve quality of life for people withALS.
Think beyond the physical changes.Many people withALSlead rewarding lives despite physical limitations. Try to think ofALSas only one part of your life, not your entire identity.
Join a support group.You might find comfort in a support group with others who haveALS. Loved ones helping with your care might benefit from a support group of otherALScaregivers. Find support groups in your area by talking to your doctor or by contacting theALSAssociation.
Make decisions now about your future medical care.Planning for the future allows you to be in control of decisions about your life and your care. It also lessens the burden for your loved ones. With the help of your health care provider, hospice nurse or social worker, you can decide whether you want certain life-extending procedures.You also can decide where you want to spend your final days. You might consider hospice care options. Planning for the future can help you and your loved ones calm anxieties.
Considering getting involved inALSresearch.ALSresearch is working toward finding a cure forALS. Consider joining a clinical trial, providing samples for research and joining the NationalALSRegistry. The registry is open to all people withALS. Many institutions collect samples for research to better understand the disease.","Your primary care provider may be the first to recognize the symptoms ofALS. Your provider will likely refer you to a doctor trained in nervous system conditions, known as a neurologist, to establish a diagnosis.",
Dry socket,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dry-socket/symptoms-causes/syc-20354376,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dry-socket/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354382,,"Dry socket is a painful dental condition that sometimes happens after you have a tooth removed. Having a tooth removed is called an extraction. Dry socket happens when a blood clot at the site where the tooth was removed does not form, comes out or dissolves before the wound has healed.
Usually a blood clot forms at the site where a tooth was removed. This blood clot is a protective layer over the underlying bone and nerve endings in the empty tooth socket. Also, the clot contains cells that are needed for proper healing of the site.
Intense pain happens when the underlying bone and nerves are exposed. Pain occurs in the socket and along the nerves to the side of the face. The socket becomes swollen and irritated. It may fill with bits of food, making the pain worse. If you get a dry socket, the pain usually begins 1 to 3 days after the tooth removal.
Dry socket is the most common complication following tooth removals, such as the removal of third molars, also called wisdom teeth. Medicine you can buy without a prescription usually will not be enough to treat dry socket pain. Your dentist or oral surgeon can offer treatments to relieve your pain.","Symptoms of dry socket may include:
Severe pain within a few days after removing a tooth.
Loss of part or all of the blood clot at the tooth removal site. The socket may look empty.
Bone that you can see in the socket.
Pain that spreads from the socket to your ear, eye, temple or neck on the same side of your face as the tooth removal.
Bad breath or a foul odor coming from your mouth.
Bad taste in your mouth.","A certain amount of pain and discomfort is typical after a tooth removal. But you should be able to manage the pain with the pain reliever your dentist or oral surgeon prescribed. The pain should lessen with time.
If you develop new pain or the pain gets worse in the days after your tooth removal, contact your dentist or oral surgeon right away.","The exact cause of dry socket is still being studied. Researchers think that certain issues may be involved, such as:
Bacteria that gets into the socket.
Injury at the surgical site when tooth removal is difficult. This can happen with irregular wisdom tooth development or position, called an impacted wisdom tooth.","Factors that can increase your risk of developing dry socket include:
Smoking and tobacco use.Chemicals in cigarettes or other forms of tobacco may prevent or slow healing. These chemicals can get into the wound site. Also, the act of sucking on a cigarette may cause the blood clot to come out too early.
Birth control pills.High estrogen levels from birth control pills may cause problems with healing and increase the risk of dry socket.
Improper at-home care.Not following home-care instructions and having poor mouth care may increase the risk of dry socket.
Tooth or gum infection.Current or previous infections around the area where the tooth was removed increase the risk of dry socket.","Even though a dry socket can be painful, it rarely causes an infection or serious complications. But healing in the socket may be delayed. Pain may last longer than usual after a tooth removal. Dry socket also may lead to an infection in the socket.",,"Severe pain following tooth removal is often enough for your dentist or oral surgeon to suspect dry socket. You'll likely be asked if you have any other symptoms. Your dentist or oral surgeon can check your mouth to see if you have a blood clot in your tooth socket or if you have lost the clot and have exposed bone.
You may need X-rays of your mouth and teeth to rule out other conditions, such as a bone infection. The X-rays also can show if you have small pieces of tooth root or bone remaining in the site after surgery.","Treatment of dry socket focuses on reducing symptoms, especially pain. Treatment may include:
Flushing out the socket.Your dentist or oral surgeon may flush out the socket to remove any food bits or other loose materials that may add to pain or possible infection.
Dressing with medicine.Your dentist or oral surgeon may pack the socket with medicated gel or paste and a dressing. These can provide quick pain relief. Whether you need dressing changes and how often and whether you need other treatment depends on how severe your pain and other symptoms are.
Pain medicine.Ask which pain medicine is best for you. You'll likely need a prescription pain medicine.
Self-care.Once your dentist or oral surgeon takes out the dressing, you may need to flush the socket at home to keep it clean and improve healing. Your dentist or oral surgeon can give you instructions. You may get a plastic syringe with a curved tip to squirt water, salt water or a prescription rinse into the socket.
Once treatment starts, you may begin to feel some pain relief. Pain and other symptoms should continue to improve and will likely be gone within a few days. Even when you're feeling better, keep scheduled appointments with your dentist or oral surgeon for dressing changes and other care.",,See your dentist or oral surgeon as soon as possible if you have new pain or pain that gets worse after a tooth removal.,"You can help promote healing and reduce symptoms during treatment of dry socket by following instructions for self-care. You'll likely be told to:
Take pain medicines as prescribed.
Do not smoke or use tobacco products.
Drink plenty of clear liquids. This also may prevent nausea caused by some pain medicines.
Rinse your mouth gently with warm salt water several times a day.
Brush your teeth gently around the dry socket area.
Be careful with eating or drinking. To prevent the clot from coming out, avoid carbonated beverages and do not use a straw."
Atypical genitalia,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atypical-genitalia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369273,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atypical-genitalia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369278,,"Atypical genitalia, formerly called ambiguous genitalia, is a rare condition in which an infant's genitals don't appear to be clearly male or female on the outside. In a baby with atypical genitalia, the genitals may not be developed fully or may look different from what is expected. Or the baby may have features of more than one sex. The sex organs on the outside of the body may not match the sex organs on the inside. And they may not match the genetic sex, which is determined by sex chromosomes: typically, XX for females and XY for males.
External genitals are the sex organs on the outside of the body. They include the opening of the vagina and the labia, clitoris, penis and scrotum. Internal genitals are the sex organs inside the body. They include the vagina, fallopian tubes, uterus, prostate, ovaries and testicles. Sex hormones are made by the ovaries and testicles, which also are called gonads. Genetic sex is set based on sex chromosomes. Typically, these sex chromosomes are a genetic female with two X chromosomes and a genetic male with one X and one Y chromosome.
Atypical genitalia is not a disease; it's a difference of sex development. Usually, atypical genitalia can be seen at or shortly after birth. The condition can be very distressing for families. Your medical team looks for the cause of atypical genitalia and provides information and counseling that can help guide decisions about your baby's sex and any needed treatment.","Your medical team will likely be the first to notice atypical genitalia soon after your baby is born. Sometimes, atypical genitalia may be suspected before birth. Atypical genitalia can vary in appearance. Differences may depend on when during genital development the hormone changes that affected development occurred and the cause.
Babies who are genetically female, which means they have two X chromosomes, may have:
An enlarged clitoris, which may look like a penis.
Closed labia, or labia that include folds and look like a scrotum.
Lumps that feel like testicles in the fused labia.
Babies who are genetically male, which means they have one X and one Y chromosome, may have:
A condition in which the narrow tube that carries urine and semen, called the urethra, doesn't fully extend to the tip of the penis. If the tube opening is on the underside of the penis, the condition is called hypospadias.
A very small penis with the urethral opening closer to the scrotum.
One or both testicles missing in what appears to be the scrotum.
Testicles that remain in the body, also called undescended testicles, and an empty scrotum that has the appearance of labia with or without a micropenis.",,Atypical genitalia usually happen when hormone changes during pregnancy stop or disturb an unborn baby's developing sex organs. An unborn baby also is called a fetus.,"Family history may play a role in the development of atypical genitalia. This is because many differences of sex development result from gene changes that can be passed down in families. Possible risk factors for atypical genitalia include a family history of:
Unexplained deaths in early infancy.
Infertility, not having menstrual periods or having a lot of facial hair in females.
Atypical genitalia.
Atypical physical development during puberty.
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a group of genetic conditions that affect the adrenal glands and are passed down in families.
If your family has a history of these risk factors, talk with your healthcare professional before trying to get pregnant. Genetic counseling also can help in planning ahead.","Complications of atypical genitalia may include:
Infertility.Whether people with atypical genitalia can have children depends on the specific diagnosis. For example, genetic females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia usually can get pregnant if they so choose.
Higher risk of certain cancers.Some differences of sex development are linked with a higher risk of certain types of cancer.",,"Atypical genitalia is usually diagnosed at birth or shortly after. Sometimes, healthcare professionals may suspect atypical genitalia during pregnancy when results of blood tests of the unborn baby's sex differ from the ultrasound imaging of the baby's genitalia. But generally, the diagnosis is not made until after birth. Healthcare professionals who help with delivery may notice the signs of atypical genitalia in your newborn.","The goal of treatment is long-term mental health and social well-being, as well as having as much sexual function and fertility as possible. When to begin treatment depends on your child's specific situation.
Atypical genitalia is complex and not common. Managing it may require a team of experts. The team might include:
Pediatricians.
Experts in newborns born early or with medical conditions, also called neonatologists.
Experts in children's urinary systems, also called pediatric urologists.
Pediatric general surgeons.
Experts in the body's hormones, also called endocrinologists.
Medical geneticists.
Mental health professionals, such as psychologists or social workers.","If your baby has atypical genitalia, you may worry about the baby's future. Mental health professionals can help you deal with this difference that you didn't expect. Ask your child's healthcare professional for a referral to a mental health professional who has experience helping people in your situation. You also may find it helpful to join a support group, either in person or online.
Your child may find ongoing counseling by mental health professionals helpful and may choose to be a part of support groups into adulthood.
Not knowing the sex of your newborn right away might turn a hoped-for celebration into a stressful time. Your medical team can provide you with updates and information as quickly as possible. They also can answer questions and talk with you about your child's health.
Consider waiting to make a formal announcement of the birth until testing is done and you've created a plan with advice from your medical team. Give yourself some time to learn and think about your child's condition before answering questions from family and friends.","If your baby is born with atypical genitalia, you may be referred to a medical center with doctors and other healthcare professionals who have expertise in managing this condition.

The weaker — or lazy — eye often wanders inward or outward.

Amblyopia generally develops from birth up to age 7 years. It is the leading cause of decreased vision among children. Rarely, lazy eye affects both eyes.

Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent long-term problems with your child's vision. The eye with poorer vision can usually be corrected with glasses or contact lenses, or patching therapy.","Signs and symptoms of lazy eye include:

Sometimes lazy eye is not evident without an eye exam.","See your child's doctor if you notice his or her eye wandering after the first few weeks of life. A vision check is especially important if there's a family history of crossed eyes, childhood cataracts or other eye conditions.

For all children, a complete eye exam is recommended between ages 3 and 5.","Lazy eye develops because of abnormal visual experience early in life that changes the nerve pathways between a thin layer of tissue (retina) at the back of the eye and the brain. The weaker eye receives fewer visual signals. Eventually, the eyes' ability to work together decreases, and the brain suppresses or ignores input from the weaker eye.

Anything that blurs a child's vision or causes the eyes to cross or turn out can result in lazy eye. Common causes of the condition include:

Difference in sharpness of vision between the eyes (refractive amblyopia).A significant difference between the prescriptions in each eye — often due to farsightedness but sometimes to nearsightedness or an uneven surface curve of the eye (astigmatism) — can result in lazy eye.

Glasses or contact lenses are typically used to correct these refractive problems. In some children lazy eye is caused by a combination of strabismus and refractive problems.",Factors associated with an increased risk of lazy eye include:,"Untreated, lazy eye can cause permanent vision loss.",,"Your doctor will conduct an eye exam, checking for eye health, a wandering eye, a difference in vision between the eyes or poor vision in both eyes. Eyedrops are generally used to dilate the eyes. The eyedrops cause blurred vision that lasts for several hours or a day.

The method used to test vision depends on your child's age and stage of development:","It's important to start treatment for lazy eye as soon as possible in childhood, when the complicated connections between the eye and the brain are forming. The best results occur when treatment starts before age 7, although half of children between the ages of 7 and 17 respond to treatment.

Treatment options depend on the cause of lazy eye and on how much the condition is affecting your child's vision. Your doctor might recommend:

Activity-based treatments — such as drawing, doing puzzles or playing computer games — are available. The effectiveness of adding these activities to other therapies hasn't been proved. Research into new treatments is ongoing.

For most children with lazy eye, proper treatment improves vision within weeks to months. Treatment might last from six months to two years.

It's important for your child to be monitored for recurrence of lazy eye — which can happen in up to 25 percent of children with the condition. If lazy eye recurs, treatment will need to start again.",,"Your child's doctor might refer you to a doctor who specializes in treating eye disorders in children (pediatric ophthalmologist).

The parasite is found in the feces of the triatomine bug. These bugs also are called reduviid. They may also be known as ""kissing bugs"" because they tend to bite people's faces.

Chagas disease is common in South America, Central America and Mexico. Rarely, Chagas disease has been found in the southern United States.

Also called American trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease can infect anyone. Untreated, Chagas disease can cause serious heart and digestive problems.

During the first phase of infection, treatment of Chagas disease aims to kill the parasite. Later, it's no longer possible to kill the parasite. Treatment in this later phase is about managing symptoms. There also are ways to prevent infection.","Chagas disease can cause a sudden, brief illness. This type of illness is known as acute. Or it can become a long-lasting, chronic condition. Both stages can be free of symptoms. Or there can be life-threatening symptoms in either phase.",See your healthcare professional if you have been in an area where Chagas disease is widespread and you have symptoms of the condition.,"The cause of Chagas disease is the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The parasite spreads from an insect known as the triatomine bug, also called the ""kissing bug."" The parasite can infect these insects when they swallow blood from an animal that is infected with the parasite.

Triatomine bugs live mainly in mud, thatch or adobe huts in Mexico, South America and Central America. They hide in crevices in the walls or roof during the day and come out at night. The bugs often feed on people while they sleep.

Infected bugs poop, called defecate, after feeding. The stool leaves parasites on the skin. The parasites can then enter the body through the eyes, mouth, a cut or scratch, or the wound from the bug's bite.

Scratching or rubbing the bite site, which often happens during sleep, helps the parasites enter the body. Once in the body, the parasites multiply and spread.

Chagas disease doesn't spread from being near an infected person. But the infection can come from:","The following can increase the risk of getting Chagas disease:

It's rare for travelers to the at-risk areas in South America, Central America and Mexico to catch Chagas disease. That's because travelers tend to stay in buildings, such as hotels, that are less likely to have Triatomine bugs. Triatomine bugs are most often found in places made from mud, adobe or thatch. But travelers should not eat salads, uncooked vegetables and unpeeled fruits.","If Chagas disease moves to the long-lasting, called chronic, phase, there can be serious heart or digestive complications. These may include:","If you live in a high-risk area for Chagas disease, these steps can help prevent infection:","Your healthcare professional does a physical exam, asking about your symptoms and anything that put you at risk of Chagas disease. If you have symptoms of Chagas disease, two or more blood tests can confirm the diagnosis.

If you're diagnosed with Chagas disease, you're likely to have more tests. These tests can show whether the disease has become chronic and caused heart or digestive complications. Tests may include:","Treatment for Chagas disease is to kill the parasite and ease symptoms.

During the acute phase of Chagas disease, the medicines benznidazole and nifurtimox (Lampit) may help. Both medicines are offered in the regions most affected by Chagas disease. In the United States, the medicines are approved for treatment of children younger than 18 with chronic infection.

Once Chagas disease becomes chronic, medicines won't cure the disease. But the medicines may be offered to help slow the disease and its most serious complications.

Other treatment depends on the symptoms.",,"You are likely to start by seeing your main healthcare provider. You may then be sent to an infectious disease specialist.

This confused state isn't caused by a more common neurological condition, such as epilepsy or stroke.

During an episode of transient global amnesia, a person is unable to create new memory, so the memory of recent events disappears. You can't remember where you are or how you got there. You may not remember anything about what's happening right now. You may keep repeating the same questions because you don't remember the answers you've just been given. You may also draw a blank when asked to remember things that happened a day, a month or even a year ago.

The condition most often affects people in middle or older age. With transient global amnesia, you do remember who you are, and you recognize the people you know well. Episodes of transient global amnesia always get better slowly over a few hours. During recovery, you may begin to remember events and circumstances. Transient global amnesia isn't serious, but it can still be frightening.","The main symptom of transient global amnesia is being unable to create new memories and remember the recent past. Once that symptom is confirmed, ruling out other possible causes of amnesia is important.

You must have these signs and symptoms to be diagnosed with transient global amnesia:

More symptoms and history that may help diagnose transient global amnesia:

Another common sign of transient global amnesia due to the inability to create new memories includes repetitive questioning, usually of the same question — for example, ""What am I doing here?"" or ""How did we get here?""","Seek immediate medical attention for anyone who quickly goes from normal awareness of present reality to confusion about what just happened. If the person experiencing memory loss is too confused to call an ambulance, call one yourself.

Transient global amnesia isn't dangerous. But there's no easy way to tell the difference between transient global amnesia and the life-threatening illnesses that can also cause sudden memory loss.","The underlying cause of transient global amnesia is unknown. There may be a link between transient global amnesia and a history of migraines. But experts don't understand the factors that contribute to both conditions. Another possible cause is the overfilling of veins with blood due to some sort of blockage or other problem with the flow of blood (venous congestion).

While the likelihood of transient global amnesia after these events is very low, some commonly reported events that may trigger it include:","Interestingly, many studies have found that high blood pressure and high cholesterol — which are closely linked to strokes — are not risk factors for transient global amnesia. This is probably because transient global amnesia doesn't represent blood vessel diseases of aging. Your sex doesn't seem to affect your risk, either.

The clearest risk factors are:","Transient global amnesia has no direct complications. It's not a risk factor for stroke or epilepsy. It's possible to have a second episode of transient global amnesia, but it's extremely rare to have more than two.

But even temporary memory loss can cause emotional distress. If you need reassurance, ask your doctor to go over the results of your neurological exam and diagnostic tests with you.","Because the cause of transient global amnesia is unknown and the rate of recurrence is low, there's no real way to prevent the condition.","To diagnose transient global amnesia, your health care provider must first rule out more-serious conditions. This can include stroke, seizure or head injury, for example. These conditions can cause the same type of memory loss.",No treatment is needed for transient global amnesia. It gets better without treatment and has no known lasting effects.,,"Anyone who experiences sudden loss of memory for all events leading up to the present needs emergency medical care. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.

Instead, people with amnesia — also called amnestic syndrome — usually know who they are. But they may have trouble learning new information and forming new memories.
Amnesia can be caused by damage to areas of the brain that are vital for memory processing. Unlike a temporary episode of memory loss, called transient global amnesia, amnesia can be permanent.
There's no specific treatment for amnesia, but treatment can be directed at the underlying cause. Tips to help enhance memory and get support can help people with amnesia and their families cope.","The two main features of amnesia are:
Trouble learning new information.
Trouble remembering past events and previously familiar information.
Most people with amnesia have problems with short-term memory, so they can't retain new information. Recent memories are most likely to be lost. More-remote or deeply ingrained memories may be spared.
For example, people may recall experiences from childhood or know the names of past presidents. But they may not be able to name the current president, know the month or remember what they ate for breakfast.
Isolated memory loss doesn't affect a person's intelligence, general knowledge, awareness or attention span. It also doesn't affect judgment, personality or identity. People with amnesia usually can understand written and spoken words and can learn skills such as bike riding or piano playing. They may understand they have a memory disorder.
Amnesia isn't the same as dementia. Dementia often includes memory loss but also involves other problems with thinking that lead to a decline in daily functioning. These problems include having trouble with language, judgment and visual-spatial skills.
Memory loss also is a common symptom of mild cognitive impairment. This disorder involves memory and other cognitive problems that aren't as severe as those experienced in dementia.","Anyone who experiences unexplained memory loss, head injury or confusion requires immediate medical attention.
People with amnesia may not know where they are or be able to seek medical care. If someone you know has symptoms of amnesia, help the person get medical attention.","Typical memory function involves many parts of the brain. Any disease or injury that affects the brain can affect memory.
Amnesia can result from damage to brain structures that form the limbic system, which controls emotions and memories. They include the thalamus found deep within the center of the brain. They also include the hippocampal formations found within the temporal lobes of the brain.
Amnesia caused by brain injury or damage is known as neurological amnesia. Possible causes of neurological amnesia include:
Stroke.
Brain inflammation, which may be due to an infection with a virus such as herpes simplex virus. Or inflammation may be a result of an autoimmune reaction to cancer somewhere in the body. It also may be due to an autoimmune reaction in the absence of cancer.
Not enough oxygen in the brain. This may happen as a result of a heart attack, respiratory distress or carbon monoxide poisoning.
Long-term alcohol misuse that leads to too little vitamin B-1, known as thiamin, in the body. When this happens, it's called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.
Tumors in areas of the brain that control memory.
Alzheimer's disease and other diseases that involve the degeneration of nerve tissue.
Seizures.
Certain medicines such as benzodiazepines or others that act as sedatives.
Head injuries that cause a concussion, whether from a car accident or sports, can lead to confusion and problems remembering new information. This is especially common in the early stages of recovery. Mild head injuries typically don't cause lasting amnesia, but more-severe head injuries may cause permanent amnesia.
Another rare type of amnesia, called dissociative amnesia, stems from emotional shock or trauma. It can result from being the victim of a violent crime or experiencing other trauma. In this disorder, people may lose personal memories and information about their lives. The memory loss is usually brief.","The chance of developing amnesia might increase if you've experienced:
Brain surgery, head injury or trauma.
Stroke.
Alcohol abuse.
Seizures.","Amnesia varies in severity and scope. But even mild amnesia takes a toll on daily activities and quality of life. The syndrome can cause problems at work, at school and in social settings.
It may not be possible to recover lost memories. Some people with severe memory problems need to be supervised or need to live in a care facility.","Damage to the brain can be a root cause of amnesia. It's important to take steps to minimize your chance of a brain injury. For example:
Don't drink large amounts of alcohol.
Wear a helmet when bicycling and a seat belt when driving.
Treat infections quickly so that they don't have a chance to spread to the brain.
Get immediate medical treatment if you have symptoms that suggest a stroke or brain aneurysm. Those symptoms include a severe headache, feeling numb on one side of the body or not being able to move one side of the body.","A comprehensive evaluation is needed to diagnose amnesia. It can rule out other possible causes of memory loss such as Alzheimer's disease, other forms of dementia, depression or a brain tumor.",Treatment for amnesia focuses on strategies to help make up for the memory problem. It's also important to address underlying diseases causing the amnesia.,"Living with amnesia can be frustrating for those with memory loss and for their family and friends too. People with more-severe forms of amnesia may require direct assistance from family, friends or professional caregivers.
It can be helpful to talk with others who understand what you're going through. They may be able to provide advice or tips on living with amnesia. Ask your health care provider to recommend a support group in your area for people with amnesia and their loved ones.
If an underlying cause for the amnesia is identified, there are national organizations that can provide additional information and support. Examples include:
Alzheimer's Association,800-272-3900(toll-free).
Brain Injury Association of America,800-444-6443(toll-free).","You're likely to start by seeing your primary care provider. However, you may then be referred to a specialist in disorders of the brain and nervous system, also called a neurologist.

Amyloidosis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyloidosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353178,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyloidosis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353183,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyloidosis/doctors-departments/ddc-20353186,"Amyloidosis (am-uh-loi-DO-sis) is a rare disease that occurs when a protein called amyloid builds up in organs. This amyloid buildup can make the organs not work properly.
Organs that may be affected include the heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, nervous system and digestive tract.
Some types of amyloidosis occur with other diseases. These types may improve with treatment of the other diseases. Some types of amyloidosis may lead to life-threatening organ failure.
Treatments may include chemotherapy with strong drugs used to treat cancer. Other types of medications can reduce amyloid production and control symptoms. Some people may benefit from organ or stem cell transplants.","You may not experience symptoms of amyloidosis until later in the course of the disease. Symptoms may vary, depending on which organs are affected.
Signs and symptoms of amyloidosis may include:
Severe fatigue and weakness
Shortness of breath
Numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet
Swelling of the ankles and legs
Diarrhea, possibly with blood, or constipation
An enlarged tongue, which sometimes looks rippled around its edge
Skin changes, such as thickening or easy bruising, and purplish patches around the eyes",See your health care provider if you regularly experience any of the signs or symptoms associated with amyloidosis.,"There are many different types of amyloidosis. Some types are hereditary. Others are caused by outside factors, such as inflammatory diseases or long-term dialysis. Many types affect multiple organs. Others affect only one part of the body.
Types of amyloidosis include:
AL amyloidosis (immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis).This is the most common type of amyloidosis in developed countries.AL amyloidosisis also called primary amyloidosis. It usually affects the heart, kidneys, liver and nerves.
AA amyloidosis.This type is also known as secondary amyloidosis. It's usually triggered by an inflammatory disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis. It most commonly affects the kidneys, liver and spleen.
Hereditary amyloidosis (familial amyloidosis).This inherited disorder often affects the nerves, heart and kidneys. It most commonly happens when a protein made by your liver is abnormal. This protein is called transthyretin (TTR).
Wild-type amyloidosis.This variety has also been called senile systemic amyloidosis. It occurs when theTTRprotein made by the liver is normal but produces amyloid for unknown reasons. Wild-type amyloidosis tends to affect men over age 70 and often targets the heart. It can also cause carpal tunnel syndrome.
Localized amyloidosis.This type of amyloidosis often has a better prognosis than the varieties that affect multiple organ systems. Typical sites for localized amyloidosis include the bladder, skin, throat or lungs. Correct diagnosis is important so that treatments that affect the entire body can be avoided.","Factors that increase the risk of amyloidosis include:
Age.Most people diagnosed with amyloidosis are between ages 60 and 70.
Sex.Amyloidosis occurs more commonly in men.
Other diseases.Having a chronic infectious or inflammatory disease increases the risk of AA amyloidosis.
Family history.Some types of amyloidosis are hereditary.
Kidney dialysis.Dialysis can't always remove large proteins from the blood. If you're on dialysis, abnormal proteins can build up in your blood and eventually be deposited in tissue. This condition is less common with more modern dialysis techniques.
Race.People of African descent appear to be at higher risk of carrying a genetic mutation associated with a type of amyloidosis that can harm the heart.","Amyloidosis can seriously damage the:
Heart.Amyloid reduces the heart's ability to fill with blood between heartbeats. Less blood is pumped with each beat. This can cause shortness of breath. If amyloidosis affects the heart's electrical system, it can cause heart rhythm problems. Amyloid-related heart problems can become life-threatening.
Kidneys.Amyloid can harm the kidneys' filtering system. This affects their ability to remove waste products from the body. It can eventually cause kidney failure.
Nervous system.Nerve damage can cause pain, numbness, or tingling of the fingers and feet. If amyloid affects the nerves that control bowel function, it can cause periods of alternating constipation and diarrhea. Damage to the nerves that control blood pressure can make people feel faint if they stand up too quickly.",,"Amyloidosis is often overlooked because the signs and symptoms can mimic those of more-common diseases.
Early diagnosis can help prevent further organ damage. Precise diagnosis is important because treatment varies greatly, depending on your specific condition.","There's no cure for amyloidosis. But treatment can help manage signs and symptoms and limit further production of amyloid protein. If the amyloidosis has been triggered by another condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis or tuberculosis, treating the underlying condition can be helpful.",,You may be referred to a doctor who specializes in blood disorders (hematologist).,

Thalassemia,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thalassemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354995,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thalassemia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355001,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thalassemia/doctors-departments/ddc-20355004,"Thalassemia (thal-uh-SEE-me-uh) is a blood disorder. It's inherited, which means it's passed from parents to children through genes. Genes carry information that can affect many things, including what people look like and whether they might have certain diseases.

Thalassemia causes the body to have less of the protein hemoglobin than usual. Hemoglobin is present in red blood cells and allows the red blood cells to carry oxygen. Not having enough hemoglobin or red blood cells can lead to a condition called anemia. That can make you feel tired and weak.

If you have a mild form of thalassemia called thalassemia trait, you do not need any specific treatment. But with more-serious forms, you might need regular blood transfusions. Those are treatments in which you receive blood from a donor. Lifestyle changes also are key. For instance, a healthy diet and regular exercise can help you manage tiredness.","There are different types of thalassemia. The symptoms that you have depend on the type and how serious it is.

Symptoms of severe thalassemia can include:

Some babies show symptoms of thalassemia at birth. Others get symptoms during the first two years of life. But some people with thalassemia don't have symptoms.",Make an appointment with your child's health care team for a checkup if your child has any of the symptoms of thalassemia.,"Thalassemia is caused by gene changes in cells that make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. The gene changes linked with thalassemia are passed from parents to children.

Hemoglobin molecules are made of protein chains called alpha and beta chains. These chains are affected by gene changes. With thalassemia, the body doesn't make enough of either the alpha or the beta chains. That causes you to get either alpha-thalassemia or beta-thalassemia, the two main types of the condition.

In beta-thalassemia, the gene change is an alteration in the DNA. Other terms used to describe these changes include mutation or variation. In alpha-thalassemia, the altered DNA consists of missing one or more copies of the four genes that program the alpha chain. This also is termed ""deletion.""

With alpha-thalassemia, the seriousness of the condition depends on the number of missing genes you inherit from your parents. The more missing copies of the genes, the worse your thalassemia.

With beta-thalassemia, the seriousness of the condition depends on which part of the hemoglobin molecule is affected.",Factors that raise your risk of thalassemia include:,"Health problems that can stem from moderate to severe thalassemia include:

Severe thalassemia can lead to the following health problems:

Enlarged spleen.The spleen is an organ that helps the body fight infection. It also helps remove old or damaged blood cells. Often, thalassemia happens along with the destruction of a large number of red blood cells. This causes the spleen to get bigger and work harder than usual.

An enlarged spleen can make anemia worse. It also can reduce the life of red blood cells received in a transfusion. If your spleen grows too big, your health care professional might recommend surgery to remove it.","Most of the time, you can't prevent thalassemia. If you have the condition or if you have the thalassemia gene changes that cause it, it is very important to talk with a genetic counselor. The counselor can offer advice on the risks of your children being affected.

Some people with thalassemia major think about getting pregnant with assisted reproductive technology. This includes procedures such as in vitro fertilization. IVF joins an egg and a sperm outside the body to make the earliest stage of an unborn baby, called an embryo. An exam called preimplantation genetic testing can then be used to check the embryo for gene changes related to thalassemia. If an embryo doesn't have these changes, it can be placed in the uterus to start a pregnancy. This might help people who have thalassemia or a related gene have healthy babies.

Another procedure that might lead to pregnancy is called intrauterine insemination. Sperm from a donor who doesn't have thalassemia or the genes related the condition is placed in the uterus to join with an egg.","Most children with moderate to severe thalassemia show symptoms within their first two years of life. If your child's health care professional thinks your child might have thalassemia, blood tests can confirm it.

Blood tests can reveal the number of red blood cells and irregular changes in their size, shape or color. Blood tests also can be used to look for gene changes in DNA.","Mild forms of thalassemia trait don't need treatment.

For moderate to severe thalassemia, treatments might include:

Chelation therapy.This treatment removes extra iron from the blood. Iron can build up due to regular transfusions. Some people with thalassemia who don't have regular transfusions also can develop excess iron. Removing the excess iron is vital for your health.

To help rid your body of the extra iron, you might need to take medicine by mouth. The medicines include deferasirox (Exjade, Jadenu) or deferiprone (Ferriprox). Another drug called deferoxamine (Desferal) is given through a needle in a vein.

Other medicines.A medicine given by shot called luspatercept (Reblozyl) helps some people need fewer blood transfusions. A medicine taken by mouth called hydroxyurea (Hydrea, Droxia) can lower the chances of getting other health problems because of thalassemia.

Stem cell transplant.This also is called a bone marrow transplant. Sometimes, it might be a treatment option. For children with severe thalassemia, it can get rid of the need for lifelong blood transfusions and drugs to control iron overload.

A stem cell transplant involves receiving infusions of stem cells from a donor with matching cells, often a healthy sibling.","If you or your child has thalassemia, reach out for help when you need it. A member of your health care team can answer your questions or offer advice.

You also could think about joining a support group. This helps you meet other people affected by thalassemia. They can listen to your experiences, and they might be able to offer useful information. Ask a member of your health care team about groups in your area.","Most often, tests find moderate to severe forms of thalassemia within the first two years of life.

Red blood cells carry oxygen to the body's tissues.

As the name implies, iron deficiency anemia is due to insufficient iron. Without enough iron, your body can't produce enough of a substance in red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen (hemoglobin). As a result, iron deficiency anemia may leave you tired and short of breath.

You can usually correct iron deficiency anemia with iron supplementation. Sometimes additional tests or treatments for iron deficiency anemia are necessary, especially if your doctor suspects that you're bleeding internally.","Initially, iron deficiency anemia can be so mild that it goes unnoticed. But as the body becomes more deficient in iron and anemia worsens, the signs and symptoms intensify.

Iron deficiency anemia signs and symptoms may include:","If you or your child develops signs and symptoms that suggest iron deficiency anemia, see your doctor. Iron deficiency anemia isn't something to self-diagnose or treat. So see your doctor for a diagnosis rather than taking iron supplements on your own. Overloading the body with iron can be dangerous because excess iron accumulation can damage your liver and cause other complications.","Iron deficiency anemia occurs when your body doesn't have enough iron to produce hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the part of red blood cells that gives blood its red color and enables the red blood cells to carry oxygenated blood throughout your body.

It affects the shape of red blood cells, which carry oxygen to all parts of the body.

Red blood cells are usually round and flexible, so they move easily through blood vessels. In sickle cell anemia, some red blood cells are shaped like sickles or crescent moons. These sickle cells also become rigid and sticky, which can slow or block blood flow.

The current approach to treatment is to relieve pain and help prevent complications of the disease. However, newer treatments may cure people of the disease.","Symptoms of sickle cell anemia usually appear around 6 months of age. They vary from person to person and may change over time. Symptoms can include:

Episodes of pain.Periodic episodes of extreme pain, called pain crises, are a major symptom of sickle cell anemia. Pain develops when sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood flow through tiny blood vessels to the chest, abdomen and joints.

The pain varies in intensity and can last for a few hours to a few days. Some people have only a few pain crises a year. Others have a dozen or more a year. A severe pain crisis requires a hospital stay.

Some people with sickle cell anemia also have chronic pain from bone and joint damage, ulcers, and other causes.","See your healthcare professional right away if you or your child has symptoms of sickle cell anemia, including fever or stroke.

Infections often start with a fever and can be life-threatening. Because children with sickle cell anemia are prone to infections, seek prompt medical attention for a fever greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit (38.5 degrees Celsius).

Seek emergency care for symptoms of stroke, which include:","Sickle cell anemia is caused by a change in the gene that tells the body to make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the iron-rich compound in red blood cells that allows these cells to carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. The hemoglobin associated with sickle cell anemia causes red blood cells to become rigid, sticky and misshapen.

For a child to have sickle cell anemia, both parents must carry one copy of the sickle cell gene and pass both copies to the child.

If only one parent passes the sickle cell gene to the child, that child will have the sickle cell trait. With one typical hemoglobin gene and one sickle cell gene, people with the sickle cell trait make both typical hemoglobin and sickle cell hemoglobin.

Their blood might contain some sickle cells, but they generally don't have symptoms. They're carriers of the disease. That means they can pass the gene to their children.","For a baby to have sickle cell anemia, both parents must carry a sickle cell gene. In the United States, sickle cell anemia most commonly affects people of African, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern descent.","Sickle cell anemia can lead to a host of complications, including:","If you carry the sickle cell trait, it can help to see a genetic counselor before you get pregnant. A counselor can help you understand your risk of having a child with sickle cell anemia. You also can learn about possible treatments, preventive measures and reproductive options.","A blood test can check for the form of hemoglobin that underlies sickle cell anemia. In the United States, this blood test is part of routine newborn screening. But older children and adults can get the test too.

In adults, a blood sample is taken from a vein in the arm. In young children and babies, the blood sample is usually collected from a finger or heel. The sample then goes to a laboratory to be screened for the sickle cell form of hemoglobin.

If you or your child has sickle cell anemia, your healthcare professional might suggest other tests to check for possible complications of the disease.

If you or your child carries the sickle cell gene, you'll likely be referred to a genetic counselor.","Management of sickle cell anemia is usually aimed at avoiding pain episodes, relieving symptoms and preventing complications. Treatments might include medicines and blood transfusions. For some children and teenagers, a stem cell transplant might cure the disease. Gene therapies also are being developed that may offer cures for people with sickle cell disease.","If you or someone in your family has sickle cell anemia, these ideas might help you cope:","Sickle cell anemia is usually diagnosed through genetic screening done when a baby is born.

This can happen if you don't eat enough foods containing vitamin B-12 and folate, or if your body has trouble absorbing or processing these vitamins.

Without these nutrients, the body produces red blood cells that are too large and don't work properly. This reduces their ability to carry oxygen.

Symptoms can include fatigue, shortness of breath and dizziness. Vitamin supplements, taken by pill or injection, can correct the deficiencies.",Vitamin deficiency anemia usually develops slowly over several months to years. Signs and symptoms may be subtle at first but usually increase as the deficiency worsens. These may include:,,"Vitamin deficiency anemia can occur if you don't eat enough foods containing vitamin B-12 and folate, or if your body has trouble absorbing or processing these vitamins.",Things that may increase your risk of vitamin deficiency anemia include:,"Being deficient in vitamin B-12 or folate increases your risk of many health problems, including:","You can prevent some forms of vitamin deficiency anemia by choosing a healthy diet that includes a variety of foods.

Foods rich in vitamin B-12 include:

Foods rich in folate include:

Most adults need these daily dietary amounts of the following vitamins:

Pregnant and breastfeeding women may require more of each vitamin.

Most people get enough vitamins from the foods they eat. But if your diet is restricted or you've had gastric bypass surgery, you may wish to take a multivitamin.","To help diagnose vitamin deficiency anemias, you might have blood tests that check for:","Vitamin deficiency anemia is treated with doses of whichever vitamin is lacking. For pernicious anemia, vitamin B-12 is usually delivered via injection and may need to be taken regularly for the rest of your life.

Vitamin B-12 is available as:

Medications to boost folate levels usually come as pills to be swallowed, but some versions can be delivered through a narrow, flexible tube into a vein (intravenously).",,"If you suspect that you have vitamin deficiency anemia, you're likely to start by seeing your family doctor or a general practitioner.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20350688,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350693,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/doctors-departments/ddc-20350695,"An abdominal aortic aneurysm is an enlarged area in the lower part of the body's main artery, called the aorta. The aorta goes from the heart through the center of the chest and belly area, called the abdomen.
An abdominal aortic aneurysm that ruptures can cause life-threatening bleeding.
Treatment depends on how big the aneurysm is and how fast it's growing. Treatment may include regular health checkups and imaging tests to emergency surgery.","Abdominal aortic aneurysms often grow slowly. You might not notice any symptoms. This makes them hard to find. Many start small and stay small. Others get bigger over time, sometimes quickly. Some aneurysms never rupture.
If you have an abdominal aortic aneurysm that's getting bigger, symptoms might include:
Deep, constant pain in the belly area or side of the belly.
Back pain.
A throbbing or pulsing feeling near the belly button.","If you have pain, especially if pain is sudden and very bad, get medical help right away.","An aneurysm can grow in any part of the aorta. Most aortic aneurysms happen in the part of the aorta that's in the belly area, called the abdomen.
Things that can cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm include:
Hardening of the arteries, called atherosclerosis.Atherosclerosis occurs when fat and other substances build up in and on the artery walls.
High blood pressure.High blood pressure can damage and weaken the aorta's walls.
Blood vessel diseases.These diseases cause blood vessels to become swollen and irritated.
Infection in the aorta.Rarely, germs can infect the aorta and cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Trauma.For example, being injured in a car accident can cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm.","Abdominal aortic aneurysm risk factors include:
Tobacco use.Smoking is the strongest risk factor for aortic aneurysms. Smoking weakens the walls of blood vessels, including the aorta. This raises the risk of aortic aneurysm and aneurysm rupture. The longer and more you use tobacco, the greater the chances are of developing an aortic aneurysm. Men ages 65 to 75 who have ever smoked should have a one-time ultrasound to screen for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Age.Abdominal aortic aneurysms occur most often in people age 65 and older.
Sex.Men get abdominal aortic aneurysms much more often than women do.
Being white.People who are white are at higher risk of abdominal aortic aneurysms.
Family history.Having a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms increases the risk of having the condition.
Other aneurysms.Having an aneurysm in the aorta in the chest (thoracic aortic aneurysm) or in another large blood vessel, such as the artery behind the knee, might increase the risk of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
If you're at risk of an aortic aneurysm, medicines may be given to lower blood pressure and relieve stress on weakened arteries.","Possible complications of abdominal aortic aneurysms include:
Tears in one or more of the layers of the wall of the aorta, called an aortic dissection.
Rupture of the aneurysm.
A rupture can cause life-threatening bleeding inside the body. In general, the larger the aneurysm and the faster it grows, the greater the risk of rupture.
Symptoms that an aortic aneurysm has ruptured can include:
Sudden, very bad and long-lasting belly or back pain, which may feel like ripping or tearing.
Low blood pressure.
Fast pulse.
Aortic aneurysms also increase the risk of developing blood clots in the area. If a blood clot breaks loose, it can block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body. Symptoms of a blocked blood vessel may include pain or reduced blood flow to the legs, toes, kidneys or belly area.","To prevent an abdominal aortic aneurysm or to keep one from worsening, take these steps:
Don't smoke or use tobacco products.If you smoke or chew tobacco, quit. Also avoid secondhand smoke. If you need help quitting, talk to your healthcare team about strategies that may help.
Eat a healthy diet.Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, chicken, fish, and low-fat dairy products. Avoid saturated and trans fats and limit salt.
Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol under control.Take medicines as directed.
Get regular exercise and stay active.Try to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity. If you haven't been active, start slowly and build up. Talk to your healthcare team about what kinds of activities are right for you.","Abdominal aortic aneurysms are often found when a physical exam or imaging test is done for another reason.
To diagnose an abdominal aortic aneurysm, a healthcare professional examines you and asks questions about your medical and family history.","The goal of abdominal aortic aneurysm treatment is to prevent an aneurysm from rupturing. Treatment may involve:
Frequent health checkups and imaging, called medical monitoring or watchful waiting.
Surgery.
Which treatment you have depends on the size of the abdominal aortic aneurysm and how fast it's growing.",,"Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you are concerned about your risk of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. If you're having severe pain, get emergency medical help.
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.","Your healthcare professional may tell you to avoid heavy lifting and vigorous physical activity. These activities may cause extreme increases in blood pressure, which can make an aneurysm worse.
Emotional stress also can raise blood pressure. Try to avoid conflict and stressful situations. If you're feeling stressed or anxious, let your healthcare professional know. Together you can come up with the best treatment plan."
Aortic aneurysm,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aortic-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20369472,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aortic-aneurysm/doctors-departments/ddc-20369475,"An aortic aneurysm is a bulge that occurs in the wall of the body's main artery, called the aorta. The aorta carries blood from the heart to the body. Aortic aneurysms can occur anywhere in the aorta. They may be tube shaped or round.
Aortic aneurysms include:
Abdominal aortic aneurysm.This type occurs along the part of the aorta that passes through the belly area.
Thoracic aortic aneurysm.This type occurs along the part of the aorta that passes through the chest cavity.
Some people may have both types of aortic aneurysms.
An aortic aneurysm increases the risk of a tear in the inner layer of the wall of the aorta. This tear is called anaortic dissection.",,,,,,,,,,,
Brain aneurysm,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20361483,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-aneurysm/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20361595,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-aneurysm/doctors-departments/ddc-20361659,"A brain aneurysm (AN-yoo-riz-um) is a bulge or ballooning in a blood vessel in the brain. It's also known as a cerebral aneurysm or intracranial aneurysm. One type of aneurysm called a berry or saccular aneurysm looks like a berry hanging on a stem.
Experts think brain aneurysms form and grow because blood flowing through the blood vessel puts pressure on a weak area of the vessel wall. This can increase the size of the brain aneurysm. If the brain aneurysm leaks or ruptures, it causes bleeding in the brain, known as a hemorrhagic stroke.
Most often, a ruptured brain aneurysm happens in the space between the brain and the thin tissues covering the brain. This type of hemorrhagic stroke is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Brain aneurysms are common. But most brain aneurysms aren't serious, especially if they're small. Most brain aneurysms don't rupture. They usually don't cause symptoms or cause health problems. In many people, brain aneurysms are found during tests for other conditions.
However, if an aneurysm ruptures it can quickly become life-threatening and requires emergency treatment.
If a brain aneurysm hasn't ruptured, treatment may be right for some people. There are many factors to be considered. If it is felt that the treatment risk is lower than the future risk of aneurysm rupture, then treatment of an unruptured brain aneurysm may be recommended. Talk about your treatment options with your healthcare professional.","Most brain aneurysms that haven't ruptured don't cause symptoms, especially if they're small. Brain aneurysms may be found during imaging tests that are done for other conditions.
If an aneurysm ruptures, this is a very serious condition, typically causing a severe headache. And if an unruptured aneurysm presses against brain tissue or nerves, it may cause pain and other symptoms.","Seek medical attention right away if you develop a sudden, extremely severe headache. If you're with someone who complains of a sudden, severe headache or who loses consciousness or has a seizure, call 911 or your local emergency number.","Brain aneurysms are caused by thinning artery walls. Aneurysms often form at forks or branches in arteries because those areas of the vessels are weaker. Although aneurysms can happen anywhere in the brain, they're most common in arteries at the base of the brain.","Several factors can cause weakness in an artery wall. These factors may increase the risk of a brain aneurysm or aneurysm rupture. Some of these risk factors develop over time while others are present at birth.
Risk factors include:
Age.Brain aneurysms can happen at any age. However, they're more common in adults between ages 30 and 60.
Being female.Brain aneurysms are more common in women than in men.
Cigarette smoking.Smoking is a risk factor for brain aneurysms to form and for brain aneurysms to rupture.
High blood pressure.This conditioncan weaken arteries. Aneurysms are more likely to form and to rupture in weakened arteries.
Drug use, particularly using cocaine.Drug use raises blood pressure. If illicit drugs are used in a vein, it can lead to an infection, which may cause an aneurysm.
Heavy alcohol use.This also can increase blood pressure.
Inherited connective tissue conditions,such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. These conditions weaken blood vessels.
Polycystic kidney disease.This inherited condition results in fluid-filled sacs in the kidneys. It also may increase blood pressure.
A narrow aorta, also called coarctation of the aorta.The aorta is the large blood vessel that delivers oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the body.
Brain arteriovenous malformation, also called brain AVM.In this condition, arteries and veins in the brain are tangled. This affects blood flow.
A family history of brain aneurysm.The risk is higher if you have family members who have had a brain aneurysm. This is particularly true if two or more first-degree relatives — such as a parent, sibling or child — have had a brain aneurysm. If you have a family history, ask your healthcare professional about getting screened for a brain aneurysm.
Some types of aneurysms may happen after a head injury or from certain blood infections.","When a brain aneurysm ruptures, the bleeding usually lasts only a few seconds. However, the blood can cause direct damage to surrounding cells and can kill brain cells. It also increases pressure inside the skull.
If the pressure becomes too high, it may disrupt the blood and oxygen supply to the brain. Loss of consciousness or even death may occur.
Complications that can develop after the rupture of an aneurysm include:
Re-bleeding.An aneurysm that has ruptured or has leaked is at risk of bleeding again. Re-bleeding can cause further damage to brain cells.
Narrowed blood vessels in the brain.After a brain aneurysm ruptures, blood vessels in the brain may contract and narrow. This is known as vasospasm. Vasospasm can cause an ischemic stroke, in which there's limited blood flow to brain cells. This may cause more cell damage and loss.
A buildup of fluid within the brain, known as hydrocephalus.Most often, a ruptured brain aneurysm happens in the space between the brain and the thin tissues covering the brain. The blood can block the movement of the spinal fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. As a result, a buildup of fluid puts pressure on the brain and can damage tissues.
Change in sodium level.Bleeding in the brain can disrupt the balance of sodium in the blood. A drop in blood sodium levels can lead to swelling of brain cells and permanent damage.","In many cases, brain aneurysms can't be prevented. But there are some changes you can make to lower your risk. They include quitting smoking if you smoke. Also work with your healthcare professional to lower your blood pressure if it's high. Don't drink large amounts of alcohol or use drugs such as cocaine.","Screening tests and procedures used to detect and diagnose brain aneurysms include:
CT scan.This specialized X-ray is usually the first test used to assess for bleeding in the brain or another type of stroke. The test produces images that are 2D slices of the brain.A CT angiogram can create detailed images of the arteries providing blood flow in the brain. The test involves injecting dye into the vein that makes it easier to observe blood flow. It also can detect the presence of an aneurysm.
Lumbar puncture, known as a spinal tap.If you've had a subarachnoid hemorrhage, there will most likely be red blood cells in the fluid surrounding your brain and spine. This fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid. If you have symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm but a CT scan doesn't show evidence of bleeding, a test of your cerebrospinal fluid can help make a diagnosis.The procedure to draw cerebrospinal fluid from your back with a needle is called a lumbar puncture.
MRI.This imaging test uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain. These images may be either 2D or 3D images and can show if there's bleeding in the brain.A type of MRI that captures images of the arteries in detail is called MR angiography. This type of MRI can detect the size, shape and location of an aneurysm.
Cerebral angiogram.During this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is used. The catheter is inserted into an artery, usually in the groin or the wrist. The catheter threads past your heart to the arteries in your brain. A special dye injected into the catheter travels to arteries throughout your brain.A series of X-rays can then reveal details about the conditions of your arteries and detect an aneurysm. A cerebral angiogram — also called a cerebral arteriogram — is usually used when other diagnostic tests don't provide enough information.","Repairing a ruptured aneurysm requires surgery or endovascular treatment. Endovascular treatment means an aneurysm is treated from inside the artery. You also may be given treatments to relieve symptoms.
If you have an unruptured aneurysm, talk with your healthcare professional about possible treatments. Talk about whether the risk of leaving the aneurysm alone is greater than the risk of treating the aneurysm.
Factors that your healthcare team considers before making treatment recommendations include:
The aneurysm size, location and overall appearance of the aneurysm.
Your age and general health.
Family history of ruptured aneurysm.
Conditions you were born with that increase the risk of a ruptured aneurysm.",TheBrain Aneurysm Foundationoffers information on connecting with support groups in many states and in other countries.,"If test results show you have a brain aneurysm, you'll need to talk with a specialist in brain and nervous system conditions. These specialists include neurologists, neurosurgeons and neuroradiologists.
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.","If you have an unruptured brain aneurysm, you may lower the risk of rupture by making these lifestyle changes:
Don't smoke cigarettes.If you smoke, talk to your healthcare professional. They can suggest strategies or a treatment program to help you quit.
Manage your blood pressure if you have high blood pressure.
Eat a healthy diet and exercise.Changes in diet and exercise can help lower blood pressure. Talk to your healthcare professional about changes that are right for you.
Don't use alcohol in excess.
Don't use recreational drugs such as cocaine, methamphetamine or others.If you do use these drugs and would like to quit, talk to your healthcare professional."

It is a type of lower extremity aneurysm.,"You might not notice any symptoms. The first symptom may be pain in the lower leg that occurs with walking, called claudication. Other symptoms of a popliteal artery aneurysm include:
Knee pain.
Lower leg pain.
Swelling behind the knee.
Pulsing feeling behind the knee.",,"An aneurysm is a ballooning in a weak spot in an artery wall. Many different things can cause the popliteal artery wall to become weak, including:
Atherosclerosis.
High blood pressure.
Wear and tear of the popliteal artery due to repeat use of the knee joint.","Popliteal artery aneurysms are rare. They are more common in men than in women.
Popliteal artery aneurysm often occurs in men with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). An abdominal aortic aneurysm is a swelling of the wall of the body's main artery, called the aorta. Anyone diagnosed with popliteal artery aneurysm should be screened forAAA.
Other risk factors for popliteal artery aneurysm include:
Growing older.
High blood pressure.
Smoking.
Narrowing of a heart valve.
Having three or more aneurysms anywhere in the body.","Complications of popliteal artery aneurysm include blood clots. Blood clots can cause a severe lack of blood flow in the lower leg.
A severe lack of blood flow can cause the following symptoms:
A change in skin color in the affected area.
No pulse behind the knee.
Skin in the affected area feels cold.
Numbness in the leg.
Inability to move the foot.
A severe lack of blood flow may result in loss of the limb. Rarely, the aneurysm may rupture. But the risk of popliteal artery aneurysm rupture is low.","Smoking and high blood pressure increase the risk of blood vessel problems that can lead to popliteal artery and other aneurysms. Following a heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent heart disease and blood vessel damage.
Try these heart-healthy tips:
Do not smoke.
Eat a nutritious diet.
Get regular exercise.","To diagnose popliteal artery aneurysm, a health care professional usually does a physical exam and checks the legs for:
Swelling.
Tenderness.
Changes in skin color or temperature on the lower leg and behind the knee.
You may be asked questions about your medical history and health habits, such as smoking.","Treatment of popliteal artery aneurysm depends on:
The size of the aneurysm.
The symptoms.
Your age and overall health.
Treatment may include:
Regular health checkups.You'll have frequent checkups and ultrasound tests to check the aneurysm, particularly if the aneurysm is small.
Medicines.Aspirin or another blood thinner is usually prescribed for people with popliteal artery aneurysm. Medicines may need to be given through a vein. Blood pressure and cholesterol medicine may be given if you have symptoms of heart disease.
Surgery.Open surgery to repair the damaged artery is generally recommended for any sized popliteal artery aneurysm that's causing symptoms. Surgery is usually done for any popliteal artery aneurysm that's 0.8 inches (2 centimeters) or larger. Sometimes, a less invasive procedure called endovascular repair may be done. During this treatment, a stent is placed inside the popliteal artery to hold it open.",,,
Thoracic aortic aneurysm,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20350188,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350193,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/doctors-departments/ddc-20350196,"A thoracic aortic aneurysm is a weakened area in the body's main artery in the chest. The body's main artery is called the aorta. When the aortic wall is weak, the artery may get wider. When the artery gets very wide, it's called an aneurysm. An aneurysm can happen anywhere in the thoracic aorta, including near the heart.
A thoracic aortic aneurysm also is called a thoracic aneurysm. If the aneurysm is between the upper and lower parts of the aorta, it's called a thoracoabdominal aneurysm.
Thoracic aortic aneurysms are less common than aneurysms in the lower part of the aorta, called abdominal aortic aneurysms.
Treatment of a thoracic aortic aneurysm depends on the cause and size of the aneurysm and how fast it's growing. Treatment may range from regular health checkups to emergency surgery. A thoracic aortic aneurysm that ruptures or causes a tear called a dissection is a medical emergency that can lead to death.","Thoracic aortic aneurysms often grow slowly. There are usually no symptoms. That makes them hard to find. Many start small and stay small. Others get bigger over time. How quickly a thoracic aortic aneurysm may grow is hard to predict.
As a thoracic aortic aneurysm grows, symptoms may include:
Back pain.
Cough.
Weak, scratchy voice.
Shortness of breath.
Tenderness or pain in the chest.
Symptoms that a thoracic aortic aneurysm has ruptured or caused a tear called an aortic dissection include:
Sharp, sudden pain in the upper back that spreads down the body.
Pain in the chest, jaw, neck or arms.
Trouble breathing.
Low blood pressure.
Loss of consciousness.
Shortness of breath.
Trouble swallowing.
Some aneurysms may never rupture or lead to dissection.",Most people with thoracic aortic aneurysms don't have symptoms until an aortic dissection or rupture occurs. An aortic dissection or aneurysm rupture is a medical emergency. Call 911 or your local emergency number for immediate help.,"Causes of thoracic aortic aneurysms may include:
Atherosclerosis.A buildup of fats, cholesterol, and other substances in and on the artery walls causes the arteries to get stiff. Over time, the walls of the arteries may get weak. High blood pressure and high cholesterol increase the risk of atherosclerosis, especially in older people.
Genetic conditions.Aortic aneurysms in younger people are often caused by changes in genes. A genetic condition called Marfan syndrome can weaken the wall of the aorta.If you have Marfan syndrome or a related condition, such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome or vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, you have a much higher risk of a thoracic aortic aneurysm. These conditions also make you more likely to have an aortic rupture or aortic dissection.
Blood vessel inflammation.Conditions that cause irritation and swelling of blood vessels, such as Takayasu arteritis and giant cell arteritis, are associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms.
Bicuspid aortic valve.Usually the valve between the lower left heart chamber and the aorta has three flaps. A bicuspid valve has only two. People who are born with a bicuspid aortic valve are more likely to get a thoracic aneurysm.
Untreated infection.Though rare, it's possible to get a thoracic aortic aneurysm if you've had an untreated infection such as syphilis or salmonella.
Traumatic injury.Some people who are injured in falls or motor vehicle crashes get thoracic aortic aneurysms. But this is rare.","Anything that damages or weakens blood vessels may raise the risk of an aneurysm. Thoracic aortic aneurysm risk factors include:
Age.Thoracic aortic aneurysms occur most often in people age 65 and older.
Smoking and tobacco use.If you smoke or chew tobacco, it's important that you quit. Using tobacco also can worsen an aneurysm and overall health.
High blood pressure.Increased blood pressure damages the blood vessels in the body. This raises the risk of an aneurysm.
Coronary artery disease.This type of heart disease causes reduced blood flow to the heart. It's often caused by atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis can damage the lining of a blood vessel, increasing the risk of an aneurysm. This is a more common risk in older people.
Family history.You're more likely to get an aortic aneurysm and rupture if you have a parent, brother, sister or child with one. You may develop aneurysms at a younger age.
If you're at risk of an aortic aneurysm, you might get medicines to lower your blood pressure and relieve stress on weakened arteries.","Possible complications of a thoracic aortic aneurysm are:
A tear in the wall of the aorta, also called an aortic dissection.This life-threatening condition causes bleeding into and along the aortic wall. Emergency surgery is needed to prevent death.
Rupture of the body's main artery, called an aortic rupture.If a tear in the aorta causes bleeding outside the aorta, it's called an aortic rupture. This also is a life-threatening condition that needs treatment right away. In general, the larger the aneurysm, the greater the risk of rupture.
Blood clots.Small blood clots can develop in the area of the aortic aneurysm. If a blood clot breaks loose from the inside wall of an aneurysm, it can block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body. This can possibly cause serious complications.
Stroke.Signs and symptoms of stroke include weakness of or an inability to move one side of the body. It may be hard to speak.","To prevent an aneurysm, keep the blood vessels as healthy as possible. Try these healthy lifestyle tips.
Don't smoke or use tobacco.
Control blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
Keep a healthy weight and stay active.
Eat nutritious foods.","Thoracic aortic aneurysms often don't have symptoms. So they can be hard to diagnose. They are often found when an imaging test is done for a different reason.
If you have a thoracic aortic aneurysm, your healthcare professional may ask about your family's medical history. Some aneurysms can run in families.","The goals of treatment for a thoracic aortic aneurysm are to:
Stop the aneurysm from growing.
Prevent aortic rupture.
Treatment depends on the aneurysm's size and how fast it's growing.
Treatment for thoracic aortic aneurysm may include:
Regular health checkups, sometimes called watchful waiting.
Medicines.
Surgery.",You may find that connecting with others who have experienced similar situations may be helpful. Ask your healthcare team about support groups in your area.,"If you have a family history of thoracic aortic aneurysms or conditions linked to them, make an appointment for a health checkup. If an aneurysm is found early, treatment may be easier and more effective.
Appointments can be brief and there's often a lot to talk about. So it's a good idea to be prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.","If you have a thoracic aortic aneurysm, your healthcare team may tell you not to do heavy lifting. You also might be told not to do some energetic physical activities. Such activities can increase blood pressure. High blood pressure can put pressure on an aneurysm.
If you want to do a particular activity, talk with your healthcare team. You may need an exercise stress test to see how activity affects your blood pressure. Moderate physical activity is generally healthy.
Emotional stress also can raise blood pressure. It's important to manage or lower stress. Some tips are to get more exercise and practice mindfulness."
Vasculitis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasculitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20363435,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasculitis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20363485,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasculitis/doctors-departments/ddc-20363525,"Vasculitis involves swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of blood vessels. The inflammation can cause the walls of the blood vessels to thicken. This thickening can narrow the vessels. If the narrowing restricts blood flow, it can damage organs and tissues.
There are many types of vasculitis. Most of them are rare. Vasculitis might affect just one organ or several. The condition can be short-term or long lasting.
Vasculitis can affect anyone. But some types are more common among people in certain age groups. Some types may improve without treatment. Most types need treatment with medicines to control the inflammation and prevent flares.","Symptoms of most types of vasculitis can include:
Fever.
Headache.
Tiredness.
Weight loss.
Aches and pains.
Other symptoms depend on the parts of the body affected:
Digestive system.If vasculitis affects the stomach or intestines, there may be pain after eating. Ulcers and tears, called perforations, are possible. They may cause blood in the stool.
Ears.Dizziness, ringing in the ears and sudden hearing loss may happen.
Eyes.Vasculitis can make the eyes look red. They may itch or burn. Giant cell arteritis can cause double vision and brief or ongoing blindness in one or both eyes. This is sometimes the first sign of the disease.
Hands or feet.Some types of vasculitis can cause numbness or weakness in a hand or foot. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet might swell or harden.
Lungs.This can cause shortness of breath or coughing up blood.
Skin.Bleeding under the skin can show up as red spots. Vasculitis also can cause lumps or open sores on the skin.",Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you have symptoms that worry you. Some types of vasculitis get worse quickly. Early diagnosis is the key to getting treatment that works.,"Experts don't know the exact cause of vasculitis. Some types are linked to a person's genes. Others result from the immune system attacking blood vessel cells by mistake. Causes of this immune system reaction may include:
Infections, such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C.
Blood cancers.
Immune system diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and scleroderma.
Reactions to certain medicines.","Vasculitis can happen to anyone. Factors that may increase the risk of certain types include:
Age.Giant cell arteritis is rare before the age of 50. Kawasaki disease is most common in children younger than 5 years old.
Family history.Behcets disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and Kawasaki disease can run in families.
Lifestyle choices.Using illicit drugs such as cocaine can increase your risk of getting vasculitis. Smoking tobacco can increase risk of Buerger disease. This applies mainly to people assigned male at birth who are younger than 45.
Medicines.Medicines such as hydralazine, allopurinol (Lopurin, Zyloprim) , minocycline (Arestin, Minocin, others) and propylthiouracil sometimes can cause vasculitis.
Infections.Having hepatitis B or C can increase the risk of vasculitis.
Immune conditions.People who have conditions in which their immune systems attack their own bodies by mistake may be at higher risk of vasculitis. These conditions include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma.
Sex assigned at birth.Giant cell arteritis is much more common in people assigned female at birth. Buerger disease is more common in people assigned male at birth.","Vasculitis complications depend on the type of vasculitis and how bad it is. Complications also may be linked to side effects of the prescription medicines that treat the condition. Complications of vasculitis include:
Organ damage.Some types of vasculitis can damage major organs.
Blood clots and aneurysms.A blood clot may form in a blood vessel, blocking blood flow. Rarely, vasculitis causes a blood vessel to weaken and bulge, forming an aneurysm (AN-yoo-riz-um).
Vision loss or blindness.This may be a complication of giant cell arteritis that isn't treated.
Infections.Some of the medicines used to treat vasculitis may weaken your immune system. This can make you more prone to infections.",,"Diagnosis starts with a medical history and a physical exam. You may have one or more tests and procedures. These can either diagnose vasculitis or rule out other conditions that cause some of the same symptoms. Tests and procedures might include:
Blood tests.These tests look for signs of inflammation, such as a high level of C-reactive protein. A complete blood cell count can tell whether you have enough red blood cells. Other blood tests, such as the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) test, can look for certain antibodies. These tests can help diagnose vasculitis.
Imaging tests.Imaging tests can show which blood vessels and organs are affected. They also can help your healthcare professional know how you respond to treatment. Imaging tests for vasculitis include X-rays, ultrasounds, CT scans, MRIs and positron emission tomography (PET) scans.
X-rays of your blood vessels.During this procedure, called angiography, a flexible catheter resembling a thin straw goes into a large artery or vein. A special dye goes into the catheter. You have X-rays taken as the dye fills the artery or vein. The X-rays show the outlines of your blood vessels.
Biopsy.This is a surgery in which a healthcare professional removes a small sample of tissue from the affected area of your body. Your health professional then looks at the tissue for signs of vasculitis.","Treatment aims to control the swelling and irritation, called inflammation. It also aims to manage the conditions that may be causing the vasculitis.
Most types of vasculitis can come back. This is called a flare. So your healthcare professional may need to follow you a long time after your symptoms go away.","Coping with the side effects of the medicines you take to treat your vasculitis might be one of the hardest things about living with the condition. Some of these tips might help:
Know about your condition.Learn all you can about vasculitis and its treatment. Know the possible side effects of the medicines you take. Tell your healthcare professional about any changes in your health.
Follow your treatment plan.Your plan may include seeing your health professional often, having more tests and checking your blood pressure.
Eat well.Eating healthy foods can help prevent some of the problems your medicines can cause. This might include thinning bones, high blood pressure and diabetes. Eat mainly fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and lean meats and fish. If you're taking a corticosteroid medicine, ask your healthcare professional if you need to take a vitamin D or calcium supplement.
Get vaccinations.Some medicines to treat vasculitis raise your risk of infections. These include flu, pneumonia, shingles and COVID-19. Keeping up to date on vaccinations can help. Talk with your healthcare professional about which vaccinations to get.
Exercise most days of the week.Regular aerobic exercise, such as walking, can help prevent conditions that can be linked to taking corticosteroids. These include bone loss, high blood pressure and diabetes. Regular exercise also helps your heart and lungs.Many people also find that exercise improves their mood and sense of well-being. If you're not used to exercising, start out and build up slowly. Your healthcare professional can help you plan an exercise program that's right for you.
Ask others to help.Family and friends can help you cope with this condition. You also might find it helpful to talk with others who have vasculitis. Ask a member of your healthcare team about support groups.","Make an appointment with your main healthcare professional if you have symptoms that worry you. For vasculitis, you may need to see specialists. They might include:
Rheumatologists, who specialize in joints, muscles and autoimmune diseases.
Neurologists, who specialize in the brain and nervous system.
Ophthalmologists, who specialize in the eyes.
Cardiologists, who specialize in the heart.
Nephrologists, who specialize in the kidneys.
Pulmonologists, who specialize in the lungs.
Dermatologists, who specialize in the skin.
Urologists, who specialize in the urinary tract and urogenital systems.
Otorhinolaryngologists, who specialize in the ears and sinuses.",
Angina,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/angina/symptoms-causes/syc-20369373,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/angina/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369378,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/angina/doctors-departments/ddc-20369379,"Angina (an-JIE-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) is a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. Angina is a symptom of coronary artery disease.
Angina also is called angina pectoris.
Angina is often described as squeezing, pressure, heaviness, tightness or pain in the chest. It may feel like a heavy weight lying on the chest. Angina may be a new pain that needs to be checked by a healthcare professional, or it may be recurring pain that goes away with treatment.
Angina is relatively common. But some people may not be able to tell it apart from other types of chest pain, such as heartburn. If you have unexplained chest pain, get medical help right away.","Angina symptoms include chest pain and discomfort. The chest pain or discomfort may feel like:
Burning.
Fullness.
Pressure.
Squeezing.
Pain also may be felt in the arms, neck, jaw, shoulder or back.
Other symptoms of angina include:
Dizziness.
Fatigue.
Nausea.
Shortness of breath.
Sweating.
The severity, duration and type of angina can vary. New or different symptoms may signal unstable angina or a heart attack.
Any new or worsening angina symptoms need to be checked immediately by a healthcare professional. The healthcare team can determine whether you have stable or unstable angina.","Chest pain that lasts longer than a few minutes and doesn't go away with rest or angina medicines may be due to a heart attack. Call 911 or emergency medical help. Only drive yourself to the hospital if there is no other way to get there.
If chest discomfort is a new symptom for you, see a healthcare professional to determine the cause and to get proper treatment. If you have stable angina and it gets worse or changes, seek medical help immediately.","Angina is caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. Blood carries oxygen, which the heart muscle needs to survive. When the heart muscle isn't getting enough oxygen, it causes a condition called ischemia.
The most common cause of reduced blood flow to the heart muscle is coronary artery disease (CAD). The heart arteries, called the coronary arteries, can become narrowed by fatty deposits called plaques. This condition is called atherosclerosis.
Plaque in a blood vessel may rupture or cause a blood clot. These events can quickly block or reduce flow through a narrowed artery. This can suddenly and severely decrease blood flow to the heart muscle.
The heart muscle may still be able to work during times of low oxygen demand without triggering angina symptoms. An example is when resting. But when the demand for oxygen goes up, such as when exercising, angina can result.","The following things may increase the risk of angina:
Increasing age.Angina is most common in adults age 60 and older.
Family history of heart disease.Tell your healthcare team if your mother, father or any siblings have or had heart disease or a heart attack.
Tobacco use.Smoking, chewing tobacco and long-term exposure to secondhand smoke can damage the lining of the arteries. Artery damage can let deposits of cholesterol collect and block blood flow.
Diabetes.Diabetes increases the risk of coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease can cause angina.
High blood pressure.Over time, high blood pressure damages arteries by speeding up the hardening of the arteries.
High cholesterol or triglycerides.Too much bad cholesterol, called low-density lipoprotein (LDL), in the blood can cause arteries to narrow. A highLDLlevel increases the risk of angina and heart attack. A high level of triglycerides in the blood also is unhealthy.
Other health conditions.Chronic kidney disease, peripheral artery disease, metabolic syndrome or a history of stroke increases the risk of angina.
Not enough exercise.An inactive lifestyle raises the risk of high cholesterol, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and obesity. Talk with your healthcare team about the type and amount of exercise that's best for you.
Obesity.Obesity is a risk factor for heart disease, which can cause angina. Being overweight makes the heart work harder to supply blood to the body.
Emotional stress.Too much stress and anger can raise blood pressure. Rushes of hormones made by the body during stress can narrow the arteries and worsen angina.
Medicines.Some medicines tighten blood vessels, which may trigger Prinzmetal angina. An example is certain migraine medicines.
Drug misuse.Cocaine and other stimulants can cause blood vessel spasms and trigger angina.
Cold temperatures.Exposure to cold temperatures can trigger Prinzmetal angina.","The chest pain that occurs with angina can make doing some activities, such as walking, uncomfortable. However, the most dangerous complication is a heart attack.","You can help prevent angina by following the same lifestyle changes that are used to treat angina:
Avoid or limit alcohol.
Don't smoke.
Eat a healthy diet.
Exercise regularly.
Maintain a healthy weight.
Manage other health conditions related to heart disease.
Reduce stress.
Get 7 to 9 hours of sleep a day.
Also get recommended vaccines to avoid heart complications.","To diagnose angina, a healthcare professional examines you and asks questions about your symptoms. You are usually asked about any risk factors, including whether you have a family history of heart disease.","Options for angina treatment include:
Lifestyle changes such as eating a healthy diet and exercising.
Medicines.
Angioplasty and stenting.
Open-heart surgery called coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
The goals of angina treatment are to:
Reduce the number of angina episodes.
Make symptoms less severe.
Lower the risk of a heart attack and death.
You will need immediate treatment if you have unstable angina or chest pain that's different from what you usually have.",,"If you have sudden chest pain, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.
If you have a strong family history of heart disease, make an appointment for a health checkup.
Appointments can be brief, and there's often a lot to discuss. So it's a good idea to take steps to prepare for your appointment. Here's some information to help you get ready and what to expect during your visit.","Heart disease is often the cause of angina. Making lifestyle changes to keep the heart healthy is an important part of angina treatment. Try these strategies:
Don't smoke.Quitting smoking is the most important thing you can do to improve heart health. Also, avoid being around secondhand smoke. If you need to quit, ask your care team for help.
Get regular exercise.Regular exercise helps improve heart health. As a general goal, aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate or vigorous physical activity five or more days a week. If you've had a heart attack or heart surgery, you may have activity limits. Ask your healthcare professional what's best for you.
Manage weight.Too much weight strains the heart. Being overweight increases the risk of high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. Ask your healthcare team what the best weight is for you.
Eat a healthy diet.Avoid or limit foods with saturated fat, trans fats, salt and sugar. Choose whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lean protein, such as fish and beans.
Manage other health conditions.Ask your care team how often you need to have your blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels checked.
Control stress.Find ways to help reduce emotional stress. Getting more exercise, practicing mindfulness and connecting with others in support groups are some ways to ease stress.
Avoid or limit alcohol.If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.
Practice good sleep habits.Poor sleep may increase the risk of heart disease and other chronic conditions. Adults should aim to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep daily. Go to bed and wake at the same time every day, including on weekends. If you have trouble sleeping, talk with your care team about strategies that might help."
Hives and angioedema,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hives-and-angioedema/symptoms-causes/syc-20354908,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hives-and-angioedema/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354914,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hives-and-angioedema/doctors-departments/ddc-20354916,"Hives — also known as urticaria (ur-tih-KAR-e-uh) — is a skin reaction that causes itchy welts that range in size from small spots to large blotches. Hives can be triggered by many situations and substances, including certain foods and medications.
Angioedema can arise with hives or alone. It causes swelling in the deeper layers of skin, often around the face and lips. Short-lived (acute) hives and angioedema are common. Most times, they are harmless, clear up within in a day and don't leave any lasting marks, even without treatment. Hives that last longer than six weeks are called chronic hives.
Hives and angioedema are usually treated with antihistamine medication. Angioedema can be life-threatening if swelling of the tongue or in the throat blocks the airway.",,"You can usually treat mild cases of hives or angioedema at home. See your health care provider if your symptoms continue for more than a few days.
If you think your hives or angioedema was caused by a known allergy to food or a medication, your symptoms may be an early sign of an anaphylactic reaction. Seek emergency care if you feel your tongue, lips, mouth or throat swelling or if you're having trouble breathing.","For most people who experience acute hives and angioedema, the exact cause can't be identified. The conditions are sometimes caused by:
Foods.Many foods can trigger reactions in people with sensitivities. Shellfish, fish, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, eggs and milk are frequent offenders.
Medications.Many medications may cause hives or angioedema, including penicillins, aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve) and blood pressure medications.
Airborne allergens.Pollen and other allergens that you breathe in can trigger hives, sometimes accompanied by upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms.
Insect bites and infections.Other causes of acute hives and angioedema are insect bites and infections.","Hives and angioedema are common. You may be at increased risk of hives and angioedema if you:
Have had hives or angioedema before
Have had other allergic reactions
Have a family history of hives, angioedema or hereditary angioedema",Severe angioedema can be life-threatening if swelling of the tongue or in the throat blocks the airway.,"To lower your likelihood of experiencing hives or angioedema, take the following precautions:
Avoid known triggers.If you know what has triggered your hives, try to avoid that substance.
Bathe and change your clothes.If pollen or animal contact has triggered your hives in the past, take a bath or shower and change your clothes if you're exposed to pollen or animals.","To diagnose hives or angioedema, your doctor will likely look at your welts or areas of swelling and ask about your medical history. You may also need blood tests or an allergy skin test.","If your symptoms are mild, you may not need treatment. Hives and angioedema often clear up on their own. But treatment can offer relief from intense itching, serious discomfort or symptoms that persist.",,"You're likely to start by seeing your primary care doctor. In some cases when you call to set up an appointment, you may be referred immediately to a skin disease specialist (dermatologist) or to an allergy specialist.","If you're experiencing mild hives or angioedema, these tips may help relieve your symptoms:
Avoid triggers.These can include foods, medications, pollen, pet dander, latex and insect stings. If you think a medication caused your rash, stop using it and contact your primary care provider. Some studies suggest that stress or fatigue can trigger hives.
Use an anti-itch drug available without a prescription.A nonprescription oral antihistamine, such as loratadine (Alavert, Claritin, others), cetirizine (Zyrtec Allergy, others) or diphenhydramine (Benadryl Allergy, others), may help relieve itching. Consider whether you might prefer a type that doesn't cause drowsiness. Ask your pharmacist about options.
Apply cold.Covering the affected area with a cold washcloth or rubbing an ice cube over it for a few minutes can help soothe the skin and prevent scratching.
Take a comfortably cool bath.Find relief from itching in a cool shower or bath. Some people may also benefit from bathing in cool water sprinkled with baking soda or oatmeal powder (Aveeno, others), but this isn't a solution for long-term control of chronic itching.
Wear loose, smooth-textured cotton clothing.Avoid wearing clothing that's rough, tight, scratchy or made from wool.
Protect your skin from the sun.Apply sunscreen liberally about a half hour before going outdoors. When outdoors, seek shade to help relieve discomfort."
Castleman disease,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/castleman-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20543017,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/castleman-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20543055,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/castleman-disease/doctors-departments/ddc-20543066,"Castleman disease is a group of rare disorders that involves lymph nodes that get bigger, called enlarged lymph nodes, and a wide range of symptoms. The most common form of the disorder involves a single enlarged lymph node. This lymph node is usually in the chest or neck, but it can occur in other areas of the body as well. This form of the disorder is called unicentric Castleman disease (UCD).
Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) involves multiple regions of enlarged lymph nodes, inflammatory symptoms and problems with organ function. There are three types of MCD:
HHV-8-associated MCD.This type is linked to human herpes virus type 8, called HHV-8, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Idiopathic MCD.The cause of this type is unknown. This also is called HHV-8-negative MCD.The most serious form of this type of MCD is known as iMCD-TAFRO. This condition gets its name from the symptoms it causes.
POEMS-associated MCD.This type is linked to another condition called POEMS syndrome. POEMS syndrome is a rare blood disorder that damages nerves and affects other parts of the body.
Sometimes, people may have 2-3 enlarged lymph nodes and mild symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic criteria for MCD. These people may have another disease, or they may have the recently described subtype of Castleman disease called oligocentric Castleman disease. This subtype is rare.
Treatment and outlook vary depending on the type of Castleman disease you have. Unicentric Castleman disease, which is the type that involves only one enlarged lymph node, can usually be successfully treated with surgery.
The best treatment for oligocentric Castleman disease, which involves a few enlarged lymph nodes and has limited symptoms, is not known but is thought to be similar to the treatment for unicentric Castleman disease.
While not all people with MCD respond to the first treatment, there are medicines that work to treat HHV-8-associated MCD and idiopathic MCD.","Many people with unicentric Castleman disease don't notice any signs or symptoms. The enlarged lymph node may be found during a physical exam or an imaging test for a different problem.
Some people with unicentric Castleman disease might have signs and symptoms that are more often seen in multicentric Castleman disease. These may include:","If you notice an enlarged lymph node on the side of your neck or in your underarm, collarbone or groin area, talk with your healthcare professional. Also call your care team if you have a lasting feeling of fullness in your chest or abdomen, fever, fatigue, or weight loss that you can't explain.","It's not clear what causes unicentric Castleman disease or idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (MCD). However, HHV-8-positive MCD is known to occur in people who don't have typical function in their immune systems because of HIV or other causes.","Castleman disease can affect people of any age or gender. People usually are diagnosed with Castleman disease during midlife, but it can happen at any age, including during childhood.
There are no known risk factors for unicentric Castleman disease or idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease. Infection with HIV or having a condition that decreases how well the immune system works raises the risk of having HHV-8-positive multicentric Castleman disease.","People with unicentric Castleman disease (UCD) usually do well once the affected lymph node is removed, and life expectancy is usually not changed. But they are at increased risk of developing a rare autoimmune condition called paraneoplastic pemphigus. This condition can be life-threatening. Paraneoplastic pemphigus causes blisters in the mouth and on the skin that are often misdiagnosed. Though the risk of developing paraneoplastic pemphigus is low, being checked for this condition is important if you have UCD.
Idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease can rapidly get worse to involve life-threatening problems with organ function. This requires critical care with a machine that helps with breathing, called a ventilator, and treatments that help with organs function, such as dialysis and transfusions.
HHV-8-positive multicentric Castleman disease may involve life-threatening infections and organ failure. People who also have HIV/AIDS generally have worse outcomes.",,"After reviewing your medical history and doing a detailed physical exam, your healthcare professional may recommend:
Blood and urine tests.These help rule out other infections or diseases. These tests also can find anemia and changes in blood proteins that can be typical of Castleman disease.
Imaging tests.These tests can find enlarged lymph nodes or an enlarged liver or spleen. A CT scan of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis may be used. A positron emission tomography scan, also known as a PET scan, may be used to diagnose Castleman disease. PET scans also can show whether a treatment is working.
Lymph node biopsy.This test is essential to diagnose Castleman disease and rule out related disorders, such as lymphoma. In a biopsy, a tissue sample from an enlarged lymph node is removed and looked at in a laboratory.",Treatment depends on the type of Castleman disease you have.,,You may be referred to a doctor trained in treating blood disorders. This type of doctor is called a hematologist.,
Broken ankle,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-ankle/symptoms-causes/syc-20450025,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-ankle/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20450038,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-ankle/doctors-departments/ddc-20450053,"A broken ankle, also called a fractured ankle, is an injury of one or more of the bones that make up the ankle joint. An ankle might break from a twisting injury, a misstep or fall, a sports injury or a car crash.

Fractures in ankle bones can range from tiny cracks to breaks in more than one place and breaks that come through the skin.

Treatment for a broken ankle bone depends on where the bone breaks and how bad the break is. A badly broken ankle may need surgery. Surgery involves putting plates, rods or screws into the broken bone to hold it in place while it heals.",A broken ankle might cause some of these symptoms:,"See a healthcare professional if the ankle has lost its shape, if the pain and swelling don't get better with self-care, or if the pain and swelling get worse over time. It's possible to walk on some fractures, so don't assume you don't need medical care if you can bear weight on your ankle.","A broken ankle is most often from a turning, twisting or rolling injury. But a direct blow to the ankle also can break it.

The most common causes of a broken ankle include:",You may be at higher risk of a broken ankle if you:,Complications of a broken ankle aren't common. But they may include:,These sports and safety tips may help prevent a broken ankle:,"Your healthcare professional will look at your ankle, foot and lower leg and check for tenderness. Moving your foot around can show your range of motion.

Sprained ankle,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sprained-ankle/symptoms-causes/syc-20353225,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sprained-ankle/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353231,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sprained-ankle/doctors-departments/ddc-20353232,"A sprained ankle is an injury that occurs when you roll, twist or turn your ankle in an awkward way. This can stretch or tear the tough bands of tissue (ligaments) that help hold your ankle bones together.
Ligaments help stabilize joints, preventing excessive movement. A sprained ankle occurs when the ligaments are forced beyond their normal range of motion. Most sprained ankles involve injuries to the ligaments on the outer side of the ankle.
Treatment for a sprained ankle depends on the severity of the injury. Although self-care measures and over-the-counter pain medications may be all you need, a medical evaluation might be necessary to reveal how badly you've sprained your ankle and to determine the appropriate treatment.","Signs and symptoms of a sprained ankle vary depending on the severity of the injury. They may include:
Pain, especially when you bear weight on the affected foot
Tenderness when you touch the ankle
Swelling
Bruising
Restricted range of motion
Instability in the ankle
Popping sensation or sound at the time of injury","Call your doctor if you have pain and swelling in your ankle and you suspect a sprain. Self-care measures may be all you need, but talk to your doctor to discuss whether you should have your ankle evaluated. If signs and symptoms are severe, you may have significant damage to a ligament or a broken bone in your ankle or lower leg.","A sprain occurs when your ankle is forced to move out of its normal position, which can cause one or more of the ankle's ligaments to stretch, partially tear or tear completely.
Causes of a sprained ankle might include:
A fall that causes your ankle to twist
Landing awkwardly on your foot after jumping or pivoting
Walking or exercising on an uneven surface
Another person stepping or landing on your foot during a sports activity","Factors that increase your risk of a sprained ankle include:
Sports participation.Ankle sprains are a common sports injury, particularly in sports that require jumping, cutting action, or rolling or twisting of the foot such as basketball, tennis, football, soccer and trail running.
Uneven surfaces.Walking or running on uneven surfaces or poor field conditions may increase the risk of an ankle sprain.
Prior ankle injury.Once you've sprained your ankle or had another type of ankle injury, you're more likely to sprain it again.
Poor physical condition.Poor strength or flexibility in the ankles may increase the risk of a sprain when participating in sports.
Improper shoes.Shoes that don't fit properly or aren't appropriate for an activity, as well as high-heeled shoes in general, make ankles more vulnerable to injury.","Failing to treat a sprained ankle properly, engaging in activities too soon after spraining your ankle or spraining your ankle repeatedly might lead to the following complications:
Chronic ankle pain
Chronic ankle joint instability
Arthritis in the ankle joint","The following tips can help you prevent a sprained ankle or a recurring sprain:
Warm up before you exercise or play sports.
Be careful when walking, running or working on an uneven surface.
Use an ankle support brace or tape on a weak or previously injured ankle.
Wear shoes that fit well and are made for your activity.
Minimize wearing high-heeled shoes.
Don't play sports or participate in activities for which you are not conditioned.
Maintain good muscle strength and flexibility.
Practice stability training, including balance exercises.","During a physical, your doctor will examine your ankle, foot and lower leg. The doctor will touch the skin around the injury to check for points of tenderness and move your foot to check the range of motion and to understand what positions cause discomfort or pain.
If the injury is severe, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following imaging scans to rule out a broken bone or to evaluate in more detail the extent of ligament damage:
X-ray.During an X-ray, a small amount of radiation passes through your body to produce images of the bones of the ankle. This test is good for ruling out bone fractures.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).MRIs use radio waves and a strong magnetic field to produce detailed cross-sectional or 3-D images of soft internal structures of the ankle, including ligaments.
CTscan.CTscans can reveal more detail about the bones of the joint.CTscans take X-rays from many different angles and combine them to make cross-sectional or 3-D images.
Ultrasound.An ultrasound uses sound waves to produce real-time images. These images may help your doctor judge the condition of a ligament or tendon when the foot is in different positions.","Treatment for a sprained ankle depends on the severity of your injury. The treatment goals are to reduce pain and swelling, promote healing of the ligament, and restore function of the ankle. For severe injuries, you may be referred to a specialist in musculoskeletal injuries, such as an orthopedic surgeon or a physician specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation.",,"Schedule an appointment or get emergency medical care for suspected sprains that don't respond to self-care strategies or that cause continued pain or instability. If your sprain is severe, you may be referred to a doctor who specializes in sports medicine or orthopedic surgery.",
Tongue-tie (ankyloglossia),https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tongue-tie/symptoms-causes/syc-20378452,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tongue-tie/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20378456,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tongue-tie/doctors-departments/ddc-20378457,"Tongue-tie (ankyloglossia) is a condition present at birth that restricts the tongue's range of motion.
With tongue-tie, an unusually short, thick or tight band of tissue (lingual frenulum) tethers the bottom of the tongue's tip to the floor of the mouth. Depending on how much the tissue restricts tongue movement, it may interfere with breastfeeding. Someone who has tongue-tie might have difficulty sticking out the tongue. Tongue-tie can also affect eating or speaking.
Sometimes tongue-tie may not cause problems. Some cases may require a simple surgical procedure for correction.","Signs and symptoms of tongue-tie include:
Difficulty lifting the tongue to the upper teeth or moving the tongue from side to side.
Trouble sticking out the tongue past the lower front teeth.
A tongue that appears notched or heart shaped when stuck out.","See a doctor if:
Your baby has signs of tongue-tie that cause problems, such as having trouble breastfeeding.
A speech-language pathologist thinks your child's speech is affected by tongue-tie.
Your older child complains of tongue problems that interfere with eating, speaking or reaching the back teeth.
You're bothered by your own symptoms of tongue-tie.","Typically, the lingual frenulum separates before birth, allowing the tongue free range of motion. With tongue-tie, the lingual frenulum remains attached to the bottom of the tongue. Why this happens is largely unknown, although some cases of tongue-tie have been associated with certain genetic factors.","Although tongue-tie can affect anyone, it's more common in boys than girls. Tongue-tie sometimes runs in families.","Tongue-tie may affect a baby's oral development, as well as the way the child eats, speaks and swallows.
For example, tongue-tie can sometimes lead to:
Breastfeeding problems.Breastfeeding requires a baby to keep the tongue over the lower gum while sucking. If unable to move the tongue or keep it in the right position, the baby might chew instead of suck on the nipple. This can cause significant nipple pain and interfere with a baby's ability to get breast milk. Ultimately, poor breastfeeding can lead to inadequate nutrition and failure to thrive.
Speech difficulties.Tongue-tie can interfere with the ability to make certain sounds — such as ""t,"" ""d,"" ""z,"" ""s,"" ""th,"" ""n"" and ""l.""
Poor oral hygiene.For an older child or adult, tongue-tie can make it difficult to sweep food debris from the teeth. This can contribute to tooth decay and inflammation of the gums (gingivitis).
Challenges with other oral activities.Tongue-tie can interfere with activities such as licking an ice cream cone, licking the lips, kissing or playing a wind instrument.",,"Tongue-tie is typically diagnosed during a physical exam. For infants, the doctor might use a screening tool to score various aspects of the tongue's appearance and ability to move.","Treatment for tongue-tie is controversial. Some doctors and lactation consultants recommend correcting it right away — even before a newborn is discharged from the hospital. Others prefer to take a wait-and-see approach.
The lingual frenulum may loosen over time, resolving tongue-tie. In other cases, tongue-tie persists without causing problems. In some cases, consultation with a lactation consultant can assist with breastfeeding, and speech therapy with a speech-language pathologist may help improve speech sounds.
Surgical treatment of tongue-tie may be needed for infants, children or adults if tongue-tie causes problems. Surgical procedures include frenotomy and frenuloplasty.",,Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment and know what to expect from your doctor.,
Anorexia nervosa,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anorexia-nervosa/symptoms-causes/syc-20353591,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anorexia-nervosa/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353597,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anorexia-nervosa/doctors-departments/ddc-20353601,"Anorexia (an-o-REK-see-uh) nervosa, often simply called anorexia, is a treatable eating disorder in which people have a low body weight based on personal weight history. Although many people with anorexia look very thin, some may not look thin and others may look overweight. But they've actually lost weight or failed to gain needed weight.
People who have anorexia often have a strong fear of gaining weight and may think they're overweight, even when they're thin. To prevent weight gain or continue to lose weight, people with anorexia often limit the amount or type of food they eat. They place a high value on controlling their weight and shape and use extreme efforts that can greatly harm their lives.
Anorexia can cause changes in the brain due to very poor nutrition, also called malnutrition. This is when people don't get the nutrients that their bodies need to stay healthy. So it's not a choice to continue the risky and damaging behavior.
If left untreated, weight loss can get to a point where people with anorexia are at high risk of serious physical harm or death. Anorexia has the second-highest death rate of any mental illness, surpassed only by opioid overdoses. Most deaths related to anorexia stem from heart conditions and suicide.
Anorexia, like other eating disorders, can take over people's lives and be very hard to overcome. Because it's related to changes in the brain, anorexia behaviors are not choices, and the illness is not really about food or looking a certain way. With proven treatment, people with anorexia can return to a healthy weight, develop more-balanced eating habits, and reverse some of anorexia's serious medical and mental health complications.","The physical and behavioral symptoms of anorexia nervosa relate to how starvation affects the brain. It may be hard to notice symptoms because what is seen as a low body weight differs for each person. Some people with anorexia may not look very thin. Also, people often hide their thinness, eating habits or physical problems.","Because of how malnutrition affects the brain, someone with anorexia may not want to be treated. A core feature of anorexia is that people with the eating disorder usually don't see how serious their symptoms are. This is because of the way anorexia affects the brain.
If someone in your life has anorexia, it's better to take action — even if you think it could be an overreaction — rather than let symptoms continue. Early treatment of eating disorders leads to the best outcomes.
If you're worried about a loved one, urge your loved one to talk to a healthcare professional. If you're a parent or caregiver who is concerned about your child's eating habits, weight or body image, share your concerns with your child's healthcare professional.
If you think you have an eating disorder, get help. If you're thinking about suicide, contact a suicide hotline. In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Or use theLifeline Chat. Services are free and confidential. The Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the U.S. has a Spanish language phone line at1-888-628-9454(toll-free).","The causes of anorexia nervosa aren't known. As with many diseases, it's probably a mix of factors:
Genetics.Although it isn't yet clear which genes are involved, genetic changes may make you more likely to develop anorexia. That involves having genetic traits that include feeling the need to be perfect or being very sensitive.
Mental health.People with eating disorders sometimes have obsessive-compulsive personality traits that make it easier to stick to strict diets and not eat, even though they're hungry. They also may try to be perfect in everything they do.
Environmental.Modern Western culture puts a lot of focus on being thin. Social media plays a big role. Peer pressure may cause you to want to be thin, lean or muscular. A constant push to eat a healthy diet could lead to very strict eating habits. These habits could turn into eating disorders.","Anorexia nervosa affects all gender identities, races, ages, incomes and body types.
Anorexia also is more common among teenagers, although people of any age can develop this eating disorder. Teens may be more at risk because of all the changes their bodies go through during puberty. They also may face more peer pressure and be more sensitive to criticism or even casual comments about weight or body shape.
Certain factors raise the risk of anorexia and other eating disorders, including:
Family history.If you have a first-degree relative — a parent, sibling or child — who had anorexia, you have a higher risk of developing it.
A history of weight bullying.People who have been teased or bullied about their weight are more likely to develop eating disorders. This includes people with peers, family members, coaches and others who have shamed them for their weight.
A history of dieting.Dieting behaviors raise the risk of an eating disorder. People who are always dieting and whose weight is always going up and down as they get on and off new diets could develop an eating disorder.
Transitions.Major changes can bring emotional stress and raise the risk of anorexia. Such changes include a new school, home or job, as well as a relationship breakup or the death or illness of a loved one.","Anorexia nervosa can have many complications. At its most severe, it can be fatal. Death may happen suddenly — even if you aren't visibly underweight. Irregular heart rhythms, also known as arrhythmias, can lead to death. Also, an imbalance of electrolytes — minerals such as sodium, potassium and calcium that maintain the balance of fluids in the body — also can lead to death.
Other complications of anorexia include:
Anemia.
Other heart conditions, such as mitral valve prolapse or heart failure. Mitral valve prolapse happens when the valve between the heart's upper and lower left chambers doesn't close properly.
Bone loss, also known as osteoporosis, which can raise the risk of fractures.
Loss of muscle.
Stomach problems, such as constipation, bloating or nausea.
Kidney problems.
In females, anorexia can lead to having no period. In males, it can decrease testosterone.
If you become severely malnourished, every organ system in your body can be damaged. This damage may not be fully reversible, even when the anorexia is under control.
In addition to physical complications, you also may have other mental health symptoms and conditions, including:
Depression and other mood disorders.
Anxiety.
Personality disorders.
Obsessive-compulsive disorders.
Alcohol and substance misuse.
Self-injury, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide.","There's no guaranteed way to prevent anorexia nervosa. Primary healthcare professionals, including pediatricians, family medicine professionals and internal medicine professionals, may be in a good position to see early signs that could lead to anorexia. For instance, they can ask questions about eating habits and satisfaction with appearance during routine medical appointments. This could open a discussion about how this relates to health and where to get help if needed.
If you notice that people have dieting habits that seem too rigid, or they're unhappy with their appearance, think about talking to them about these issues. Although you may not be able to prevent an eating disorder from starting, you can talk about your concerns and offer to assist them in finding help if needed.
Examples of organizations that offer support for caregivers, friends and family members of people with eating disorders include the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) and Families Empowered and Supporting Treatment for Eating Disorders (F.E.A.S.T.).","If your healthcare professional thinks that you have anorexia nervosa, you may have several tests and exams to pinpoint a diagnosis, rule out medical causes for the weight loss and check for any related complications.
These exams and tests generally include:
Physical exam.This exam includes measuring your height and weight and checking your vital signs. Vital signs include heart rate, blood pressure and temperature. Usually, the exam also includes checking skin and nails for problems, listening to the heart and lungs, and looking at the stomach area.
Lab tests.These may include a complete blood count (CBC) and more-specialized blood tests to check electrolytes and protein, as well as the function of your liver, kidney and thyroid. A urine test also may be done.
Mental health evaluation.Your healthcare professional likely will ask about your thoughts, feelings and eating habits. Your healthcare professional also may ask you to answer a series of questions about your health.
Other studies.X-rays may be taken to check your bone density, check for stress fractures or broken bones, or check for pneumonia or heart problems. An electrocardiogram may be done to look for heart issues.","It's best to treat anorexia nervosa using a team approach. The team includes doctors, mental health professionals and other healthcare professionals — all with experience in treating eating disorders.
Here's a look at what's commonly involved in treatment.","You may find it hard to cope with anorexia nervosa when media and culture — and maybe your own family or friends — give you mixed messages about what you should look like. Whether you have anorexia or your loved one has anorexia, ask your healthcare professional for advice on coping strategies and emotional support around diet culture and weight stigma that are so common. Learning effective coping strategies and getting the support you need from family and friends are vital to successful treatment.","Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment and know what to expect from your healthcare professional.
You may want to ask a family member or friend to go with you. Someone who goes with you may remember something that you missed or forgot. A family member also may be able to give your healthcare professional a fuller picture of your home life.","When you have anorexia nervosa, it can be hard to take care of yourself properly. In addition to professional treatment, follow these steps:
Stay with your treatment plan.Don't skip therapy sessions and try not to stray from meal plans, even if they make you uncomfortable.
Talk to your healthcare professional about proper vitamin and mineral supplements.Many people get their vitamins and minerals from food. But if you're not eating well, your body probably isn't getting all the nutrients it needs, such as vitamin D or iron.
Don't isolate yourselffrom caring family members and friends who want to see you get healthy. Understand that they have your best interests at heart.
Resist urges to weigh yourself outside of medical appointmentsor check yourself in the mirror frequently. These actions may do nothing but fuel your drive to keep unhealthy habits."
ACL injury,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acl-injury/symptoms-causes/syc-20350738,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acl-injury/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350744,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acl-injury/doctors-departments/ddc-20350745,"AnACLinjury is a tear or sprain of the anterior cruciate (KROO-she-ate) ligament (ACL) — one of the strong bands of tissue that help connect your thigh bone (femur) to your shinbone (tibia).ACLinjuries most commonly occur during sports that involve sudden stops or changes in direction, jumping and landing — such as soccer, basketball, football and downhill skiing.
Many people hear a pop or feel a ""popping"" sensation in the knee when anACLinjury occurs. Your knee may swell, feel unstable and become too painful to bear weight.
Depending on the severity of yourACLinjury, treatment may include rest and rehabilitation exercises to help you regain strength and stability, or surgery to replace the torn ligament followed by rehabilitation. A proper training program may help reduce the risk of anACLinjury.","Signs and symptoms of anACLinjury usually include:
A loud pop or a ""popping"" sensation in the knee
Severe pain and inability to continue activity
Rapid swelling
Loss of range of motion
A feeling of instability or ""giving way"" with weight bearing","Seek immediate care if any injury to your knee causes signs or symptoms of anACLinjury. The knee joint is a complex structure of bones, ligaments, tendons and other tissues that work together. It's important to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis to determine the severity of the injury and get proper treatment.","Ligaments are strong bands of tissue that connect one bone to another. TheACL, one of two ligaments that cross in the middle of the knee, connects your thighbone to your shinbone and helps stabilize your knee joint.
ACLinjuries often happen during sports and fitness activities that can put stress on the knee:
Suddenly slowing down and changing direction (cutting)
Pivoting with your foot firmly planted
Landing awkwardly from a jump
Stopping suddenly
Receiving a direct blow to the knee or having a collision, such as a football tackle
When the ligament is damaged, there is usually a partial or complete tear of the tissue. A mild injury may stretch the ligament but leave it intact.","There are a number of factors that increase your risk of anACLinjury, including:
Being female — possibly due to differences in anatomy, muscle strength and hormonal influences
Participating in certain sports, such as soccer, football, basketball, gymnastics and downhill skiing
Poor conditioning
Using faulty movement patterns, such as moving the knees inward during a squat
Wearing footwear that doesn't fit properly
Using poorly maintained sports equipment, such as ski bindings that aren't adjusted properly
Playing on artificial turf","People who experience anACLinjury have a higher risk of developing osteoarthritis in the knee. Arthritis may occur even if you have surgery to reconstruct the ligament.
Multiple factors likely influence the risk of arthritis, such as the severity of the original injury, the presence of related injuries in the knee joint or the level of activity after treatment.","Proper training and exercise can help reduce the risk ofACLinjury. A sports medicine physician, physical therapist, athletic trainer or other specialist in sports medicine can provide assessment, instruction and feedback that can help you reduce risks.
Programs to reduceACLinjury include:
Exercises to strengthen the core — including the hips, pelvis and lower abdomen — with a goal of training athletes to avoid moving the knee inward during a squat
Exercises that strengthen leg muscles, particularly hamstring exercises, to ensure an overall balance in leg muscle strength
Training and exercise emphasizing proper technique and knee position when jumping and landing from jumps
Training to improve technique when performing pivoting and cutting movements
Training to strengthen muscles of the legs, hips and core — as well as training to improve jumping and landing techniques and to prevent inward movement of the knee — may help to reduce the higherACLinjury risk in female athletes.","During the physical exam, your doctor will check your knee for swelling and tenderness — comparing your injured knee to your uninjured knee. He or she may also move your knee into a variety of positions to assess range of motion and overall function of the joint.
Often the diagnosis can be made on the basis of the physical exam alone, but you may need tests to rule out other causes and to determine the severity of the injury. These tests may include:
X-rays.X-rays may be needed to rule out a bone fracture. However, X-rays don't show soft tissues, such as ligaments and tendons.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).AnMRIuses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to create images of both hard and soft tissues in your body. AnMRIcan show the extent of anACLinjury and signs of damage to other tissues in the knee, including the cartilage.
Ultrasound.Using sound waves to visualize internal structures, ultrasound may be used to check for injuries in the ligaments, tendons and muscles of the knee.","Prompt first-aid care can reduce pain and swelling immediately after an injury to your knee. Follow theR.I.C.E.model of self-care at home:
Rest.General rest is necessary for healing and limits weight bearing on your knee.
Ice.When you're awake, try to ice your knee at least every two hours for 20 minutes at a time.
Compression.Wrap an elastic bandage or compression wrap around your knee.
Elevation.Lie down with your knee propped up on pillows.",,"The pain and disability associated with anACLinjury prompt many people to seek immediate medical attention. Others may make an appointment with their family doctors. Depending on the severity of your injury, you may be referred to a doctor specializing in sports medicine or a specialist in bone and joint surgery (orthopedic surgeon).",
Anterior vaginal prolapse (cystocele),https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cystocele/symptoms-causes/syc-20369452,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cystocele/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369457,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cystocele/doctors-departments/ddc-20369459,"Anterior vaginal prolapse happens when the bladder drops from its place in the pelvis and pushes on the front wall of the vagina. The condition also is called a cystocele (SIS-toe-seel) or a prolapsed bladder.
Muscles and connective tissues of the pelvic floor hold the organs of the pelvis in place. These organs include the bladder, uterus and rectum. Anterior prolapse happens when the pelvic floor becomes weak or when there's too much pressure on the pelvic floor. This can happen with aging, during vaginal childbirth, or with ongoing constipation, hard coughing or heavy lifting.
Treatments for anterior prolapse include watchful waiting, devices that hold the organs in place, called pessaries, and exercises to strengthen pelvic floor muscles. Some people have surgery.","People with mild anterior prolapse may not see or feel any symptoms. When there are symptoms, they may include:
A feeling of fullness or pressure in the pelvis and vagina.
A bulge of tissue in the vagina that you can see or feel.
More pelvic pressure when you strain, cough, bear down or lift objects.
Problems urinating. These may include having trouble starting a urine stream, feeling that the bladder isn't empty after urinating, feeling a need to urinate often or leaking urine, also called urinary incontinence.
You may notice symptoms more after standing for long periods. Symptoms may go away when you lie down.","A prolapsed bladder may cause discomfort, but it's rarely painful. It can make emptying the bladder hard, which may lead to bladder infections. Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you have symptoms that bother you or affect your daily life.","The cause of anterior vaginal prolapse is a weakened pelvic floor. The pelvic floor has muscles, ligaments and connective tissues that support the bladder and other pelvic organs.
Aging, giving birth or straining a lot can cause the weakness. When this happens, the bladder can slip down and push into the vagina, causing a bulge.
Causes of stress to the pelvic floor include:
Pregnancy and vaginal childbirth.
Being overweight or obese.
Repeated heavy lifting.
Straining when passing stool.
A long-term cough or bronchitis.","These factors may raise the risk of anterior prolapse:
Pregnancy and childbirth.People who have had a vaginal delivery or had a delivery with tools such as forceps have a higher risk of anterior prolapse. Other risk factors are having more than one pregnancy and having infants with high birth weights.
Aging.The risk of anterior prolapse goes up as you age. This is mainly true after menopause due to having less of the sex hormone estrogen.
Hysterectomy.Having the uterus removed may add to weakness in the pelvic floor. But this does not always happen.
Certain genes passed through families, called inherited.Some people are born with weaker connective tissues. This makes them more likely to have anterior prolapse.
Obesity.People who are overweight and those with obesity are at higher risk of anterior prolapse.",,,"Diagnosis of anterior prolapse may involve:
A pelvic exam.Your healthcare professional may examine your pelvis. This is to see if there's a tissue bulge in your vagina.Your healthcare professional may ask you to bear down as you do when passing stool. This shows how bearing down affects the prolapse. You also contract your pelvic floor muscles as you do when stopping the stream of urine. This is to check the strength of the pelvic floor muscles.
Medical history.This includes medical and surgical history and history of pregnancies.
Bladder and urine tests.Some people have tests to see how well the bladder empties. Your healthcare professional also may test a urine sample to look for signs of a bladder infection.","Treatment depends on your symptoms, how much they bother you, the degree of your prolapse and whether you have any related conditions. These might include urinary incontinence or more than one type of pelvic organ prolapse.
People who have few or no symptoms most often don't need treatment. Your healthcare professional may suggest a wait-and-see approach. You have follow-up visits to check the prolapse.
If you have symptoms of anterior prolapse that bother you, treatments may include:
Pelvic floor muscle exercises.These exercises also are called Kegel exercises. They strengthen pelvic floor muscles to help them support the bladder and other pelvic organs. Your main healthcare professional or a physical therapist can tell you how to do these exercises.Having a physical therapist teach you Kegel exercises using biofeedback may be the best way to learn to do them. During biofeedback, a healthcare professional connects you to sensors that let you know that you're doing the exercises right.
A device that gives support, called a pessary.A vaginal pessary is a silicone ring put into the vagina to support the bladder. A pessary does not fix the prolapse, but it can help ease symptoms.A healthcare professional fits you for the device and shows you how to remove it, clean it and put it back in. Many people use pessaries for a time before having surgery. Some people use them when they don't want surgery or surgery is too risky.",,"Make an appointment with your main healthcare professional or gynecologist if you have symptoms of anterior prolapse that bother you.
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.","Kegel exercises are exercises you can do at home to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. A stronger pelvic floor gives better support for the pelvic organs and may give relief from symptoms of anterior prolapse.
To do Kegel exercises, follow these steps:
Tighten your pelvic floor muscles. These are the muscles you use to stop urinating.
Hold the tightened muscle, called a contraction, for five seconds. Then relax for five seconds. If this is too hard, start by holding for two seconds and relaxing for three seconds.
Work up to holding the contraction for 10 seconds at a time.
Repeat the exercises 10 times. Do each set three times a day.
Ask your healthcare professional to teach you how to do Kegel exercises. Once you've learned how, you can do Kegel exercises any time with no one knowing. Try them while sitting at your desk or relaxing on the couch.
To help keep an anterior prolapse from getting worse, you also can try the following:
Treat and prevent constipation.High-fiber foods can help.
Don't do heavy lifting.Use good form to lift objects that aren't too heavy. Stand as close as you can to what you're lifting. Don't bend forward to lift. Instead bend your knees so that you use your legs to lift.
Manage coughing.Get treatment for a long-term cough or bronchitis. And don't smoke.
Manage your weight.Talk to your healthcare professional about what's a good weight for you. Ask for help with losing weight if you need to."

Pseudomembranous colitis is sometimes called antibiotic-associated colitis or Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) colitis.

This overgrowth of C. difficile is often related to a recent hospital stay or antibiotic treatment.(C. difficil e) infections are more common in people over 65 years old.","Symptoms of pseudomembranous colitis may include:

Symptoms of pseudomembranous colitis can begin as soon as 1 to 2 days after you start taking an antibiotic, or as long as several months or longer after you finish taking the antibiotic.","If you are currently taking or have recently taken antibiotics and you develop diarrhea, contact your health care provider, even if the diarrhea is relatively mild. Also, see your provider anytime you have severe diarrhea, with a fever, painful stomach cramps, or blood or pus in your stool.","Your body usually keeps the many bacteria in your colon in a naturally healthy balance. However, antibiotics and other medicines can upset this balance. Pseudomembranous colitis occurs when certain bacteria, usually clostridioides difficile (C. difficile), rapidly outgrow other bacteria that typically keep them in check. Certain toxins produced by C. difficile can rise to levels high enough to damage the colon.

While almost any antibiotic can cause pseudomembranous colitis, some antibiotics are more commonly linked to pseudomembranous colitis than others, including:",Factors that may increase your risk of pseudomembranous colitis include:,"Treatment of pseudomembranous colitis is usually successful. However, even with prompt diagnosis and treatment, pseudomembranous colitis can be life-threatening. Possible complications include:

In addition, pseudomembranous colitis may sometimes return, days or even weeks after apparently successful treatment.","To help prevent the spread of Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile), hospitals and other health care facilities follow strict infection-control guidelines. If you have a friend or family member in a hospital or nursing home, don't be afraid to remind caregivers to follow the recommended precautions.

Preventive measures include:",Tests and procedures used to diagnose pseudomembranous colitis and to search for complications include:,"Treatment strategies include:

Starting an antibiotic likely to be effective against Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile).If you still experience symptoms, your health care provider may use a different antibiotic to treat C. difficile. This allows typical bacteria to grow back, restoring the healthy balance of bacteria in your colon.

You may be given antibiotics by mouth, through a vein or through a tube inserted through the nose into the stomach, called a nasogastric tube. Vancomycin or fidaxomicin (Dificid) is most often used, but the choice depends on your condition. If these medicines are not available or you cannot tolerate them, then metronidazole (Flagyl) may be used.

For severe disease, your provider may prescribe vancomycin by mouth combined with intravenous metronidazole or a vancomycin enema.

Once you begin treatment for pseudomembranous colitis, symptoms may begin to improve within a few days.",,"Your primary health care provider can usually treat pseudomembranous colitis. Based on your symptoms, you may be referred to a specialist in digestive diseases, known as a gastroenterologist.

However, excessive, ongoing anxiety and worry that are difficult to control and interfere with day-to-day activities may be a sign of generalized anxiety disorder.
It's possible to develop generalized anxiety disorder as a child or an adult. Generalized anxiety disorder has symptoms that are similar to panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and other types of anxiety, but they're all different conditions.
Living with generalized anxiety disorder can be a long-term challenge. In many cases, it occurs along with other anxiety or mood disorders. In most cases, generalized anxiety disorder improves with psychotherapy or medications. Making lifestyle changes, learning coping skills and using relaxation techniques also can help.","Generalized anxiety disorder symptoms can vary. They may include:
Persistent worrying or anxiety about a number of areas that are out of proportion to the impact of the events
Overthinking plans and solutions to all possible worst-case outcomes
Perceiving situations and events as threatening, even when they aren't
Difficulty handling uncertainty
Indecisiveness and fear of making the wrong decision
Inability to set aside or let go of a worry
Inability to relax, feeling restless, and feeling keyed up or on edge
Difficulty concentrating, or the feeling that your mind ""goes blank""
Physical signs and symptoms may include:
Fatigue
Trouble sleeping
Muscle tension or muscle aches
Trembling, feeling twitchy
Nervousness or being easily startled
Sweating
Nausea, diarrhea or irritable bowel syndrome
Irritability
There may be times when your worries don't completely consume you, but you still feel anxious even when there's no apparent reason. For example, you may feel intense worry about your safety or that of your loved ones, or you may have a general sense that something bad is about to happen.
Your anxiety, worry or physical symptoms cause you significant distress in social, work or other areas of your life. Worries can shift from one concern to another and may change with time and age.
Children and teenagers may have similar worries to adults, but also may have excessive worries about:
Performance at school or sporting events
Family members' safety
Being on time (punctuality)
Earthquakes, nuclear war or other catastrophic events
A child or teen with excessive worry may:
Feel overly anxious to fit in
Be a perfectionist
Redo tasks because they aren't perfect the first time
Spend excessive time doing homework
Lack confidence
Strive for approval
Require a lot of reassurance about performance
Have frequent stomachaches or other physical complaints
Avoid going to school or avoid social situations
Some anxiety is normal, but see your doctor if:
You feel like you're worrying too much, and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life
You feel depressed or irritable, have trouble with drinking or drugs, or you have other mental health concerns along with anxiety
You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors — seek emergency treatment immediately
Your worries are unlikely to simply go away on their own, and they may actually get worse over time. Try to seek professional help before your anxiety becomes severe — it may be easier to treat early on.",,"As with many mental health conditions, the cause of generalized anxiety disorder likely arises from a complex interaction of biological and environmental factors, which may include:
Differences in brain chemistry and function
Genetics
Differences in the way threats are perceived
Development and personality","Women are diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder somewhat more often than men are. The following factors may increase the risk of developing generalized anxiety disorder:
Personality.A person whose temperament is timid or negative or who avoids anything dangerous may be more prone to generalized anxiety disorder than others are.
Genetics.Generalized anxiety disorder may run in families.
Experiences.People with generalized anxiety disorder may have a history of significant life changes, traumatic or negative experiences during childhood, or a recent traumatic or negative event. Chronic medical illnesses or other mental health disorders may increase risk.","Having generalized anxiety disorder can be disabling. It can:
Impair your ability to perform tasks quickly and efficiently because you have trouble concentrating
Take your time and focus from other activities
Sap your energy
Increase your risk of depression
Generalized anxiety disorder can also lead to or worsen other physical health conditions, such as:
Digestive or bowel problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome or ulcers
Headaches and migraines
Chronic pain and illness
Sleep problems and insomnia
Heart-health issues
Generalized anxiety disorder often occurs along with other mental health problems, which can make diagnosis and treatment more challenging. Some mental health disorders that commonly occur with generalized anxiety disorder include:
Phobias
Panic disorder
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
Depression
Suicidal thoughts or suicide
Substance abuse","There's no way to predict for certain what will cause someone to develop generalized anxiety disorder, but you can take steps to reduce the impact of symptoms if you experience anxiety:
Get help early.Anxiety, like many other mental health conditions, can be harder to treat if you wait.
Keep a journal.Keeping track of your personal life can help you and your mental health professional identify what's causing you stress and what seems to help you feel better.
Prioritize issues in your life.You can reduce anxiety by carefully managing your time and energy.
Avoid unhealthy substance use.Alcohol and drug use and even nicotine or caffeine use can cause or worsen anxiety. If you're addicted to any of these substances, quitting can make you anxious. If you can't quit on your own, see your doctor or find a treatment program or support group to help you.","To help diagnose generalized anxiety disorder, your doctor or mental health professional may:
Do a physical exam to look for signs that your anxiety might be linked to medications or an underlying medical condition
Order blood or urine tests or other tests, if a medical condition is suspected
Ask detailed questions about your symptoms and medical history
Use psychological questionnaires to help determine a diagnosis
Use the criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association",Treatment decisions are based on how significantly generalized anxiety disorder is affecting your ability to function in your daily life. The two main treatments for generalized anxiety disorder are psychotherapy and medications. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you.,"To cope with generalized anxiety disorder, here's what you can do:
Stick to your treatment plan.Take medications as directed. Keep therapy appointments. Practice the skills you learn in psychotherapy. Consistency can make a big difference, especially when it comes to taking your medication.
Take action.Work with your mental health professional to figure out what's making you anxious and address it.
Let it go.Don't dwell on past concerns. Change what you can in the present moment and let the rest take its course.
Break the cycle.When you feel anxious, take a brisk walk or delve into a hobby to refocus your mind away from your worries.
Socialize.Don't let worries isolate you from loved ones or enjoyable activities. Social interaction and caring relationships can lessen your worries.
Join a support group for people with anxiety.Here, you can find compassion, understanding and shared experiences. You may find support groups in your community or on the internet, for example, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).","You may see your primary care doctor, or your doctor may refer you to a mental health professional. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.","While most people with anxiety disorders need psychotherapy or medications to get anxiety under control, lifestyle changes also can make a difference. Here's what you can do:
Keep physically active.Develop a routine so that you're physically active most days of the week. Exercise is a powerful stress reducer. It may improve your mood and help you stay healthy. Start out slowly and gradually increase the amount and intensity of your activities.
Make sleep a priority.Do what you can to make sure you're getting enough sleep to feel rested. If you aren't sleeping well, see your doctor.
Use relaxation techniques.Visualization techniques, meditation and yoga are examples of relaxation techniques that can ease anxiety.
Eat healthy.Healthy eating — such as focusing on vegetables, fruits, whole grains and fish — may be linked to reduced anxiety, but more research is needed.
Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs.These substances can worsen anxiety.
Quit smoking and cut back or quit drinking coffee.Both nicotine and caffeine can worsen anxiety."

For example, going on a date or giving a presentation may cause that feeling of butterflies in your stomach. But in social anxiety disorder, also called social phobia, everyday interactions cause significant anxiety, self-consciousness and embarrassment because you fear being scrutinized or judged negatively by others.
In social anxiety disorder, fear and anxiety lead to avoidance that can disrupt your life. Severe stress can affect your relationships, daily routines, work, school or other activities.
Social anxiety disorder can be a chronic mental health condition, but learning coping skills in psychotherapy and taking medications can help you gain confidence and improve your ability to interact with others.","Feelings of shyness or discomfort in certain situations aren't necessarily signs of social anxiety disorder, particularly in children. Comfort levels in social situations vary, depending on personality traits and life experiences. Some people are naturally reserved and others are more outgoing.
In contrast to everyday nervousness, social anxiety disorder includes fear, anxiety and avoidance that interfere with relationships, daily routines, work, school or other activities. Social anxiety disorder typically begins in the early to mid-teens, though it can sometimes start in younger children or in adults.
Signs and symptoms of social anxiety disorder can include constant:
Fear of situations in which you may be judged negatively
Worry about embarrassing or humiliating yourself
Intense fear of interacting or talking with strangers
Fear that others will notice that you look anxious
Fear of physical symptoms that may cause you embarrassment, such as blushing, sweating, trembling or having a shaky voice
Avoidance of doing things or speaking to people out of fear of embarrassment
Avoidance of situations where you might be the center of attention
Anxiety in anticipation of a feared activity or event
Intense fear or anxiety during social situations
Analysis of your performance and identification of flaws in your interactions after a social situation
Expectation of the worst possible consequences from a negative experience during a social situation
For children, anxiety about interacting with adults or peers may be shown by crying, having temper tantrums, clinging to parents or refusing to speak in social situations.
Performance type of social anxiety disorder is when you experience intense fear and anxiety during speaking or performing in public but not in other types of more general social situations.
Physical signs and symptoms can sometimes accompany social anxiety disorder and may include:
Blushing
Fast heartbeat
Trembling
Sweating
Upset stomach or nausea
Trouble catching your breath
Dizziness or lightheadedness
Feeling that your mind has gone blank
Muscle tension
Common, everyday experiences may be hard to endure when you have social anxiety disorder, including:
Interacting with unfamiliar people or strangers
Attending parties or social gatherings
Going to work or school
Starting conversations
Making eye contact
Dating
Entering a room in which people are already seated
Returning items to a store
Eating in front of others
Using a public restroom
Social anxiety disorder symptoms can change over time. They may flare up if you're facing a lot of changes, stress or demands in your life. Although avoiding situations that produce anxiety may make you feel better in the short term, your anxiety is likely to continue over the long term if you don't get treatment.
See your doctor or a mental health professional if you fear and avoid normal social situations because they cause embarrassment, worry or panic.",,"Like many other mental health conditions, social anxiety disorder likely arises from a complex interaction of biological and environmental factors. Possible causes include:
Inherited traits.Anxiety disorders tend to run in families. However, it isn't entirely clear how much of this may be due to genetics and how much is due to learned behavior.
Brain structure.A structure in the brain called the amygdala (uh-MIG-duh-luh) may play a role in controlling the fear response. People who have an overactive amygdala may have a heightened fear response, causing increased anxiety in social situations.
Environment.Social anxiety disorder may be a learned behavior — some people may develop significant anxiety after an unpleasant or embarrassing social situation. Also, there may be an association between social anxiety disorder and parents who either model anxious behavior in social situations or are more controlling or overprotective of their children.","Several factors can increase the risk of developing social anxiety disorder, including:
Family history.You're more likely to develop social anxiety disorder if your biological parents or siblings have the condition.
Negative experiences.Children who experience teasing, bullying, rejection, ridicule or humiliation may be more prone to social anxiety disorder. In addition, other negative events in life, such as family conflict, trauma or abuse, may be associated with this disorder.
Temperament.Children who are shy, timid, withdrawn or restrained when facing new situations or people may be at greater risk.
New social or work demands.Social anxiety disorder symptoms typically start in the teenage years, but meeting new people, giving a speech in public or making an important work presentation may trigger symptoms for the first time.
Having an appearance or condition that draws attention.For example, facial disfigurement, stuttering or tremors due to Parkinson's disease can increase feelings of self-consciousness and may trigger social anxiety disorder in some people.","Left untreated, social anxiety disorder can control your life. Anxieties can interfere with work, school, relationships or enjoyment of life. This disorder can cause:
Low self-esteem
Trouble being assertive
Negative self-talk
Hypersensitivity to criticism
Poor social skills
Isolation and difficult social relationships
Low academic and employment achievement
Substance abuse, such as drinking too much alcohol
Suicide or suicide attempts
Other anxiety disorders and certain other mental health disorders, particularly major depressive disorder and substance abuse problems, often occur with social anxiety disorder.","There's no way to predict what will cause someone to develop an anxiety disorder, but you can take steps to reduce the impact of symptoms if you're anxious:
Get help early.Anxiety, like many other mental health conditions, can be harder to treat if you wait.
Keep a journal.Keeping track of your personal life can help you and your mental health professional identify what's causing you stress and what seems to help you feel better.
Set priorities in your life.You can reduce anxiety by carefully managing your time and energy. Make sure that you spend time doing things you enjoy.
Avoid unhealthy substance use.Alcohol and drug use and even caffeine or nicotine use can cause or worsen anxiety. If you're addicted to any of these substances, quitting can make you anxious. If you can't quit on your own, see your health care provider or find a treatment program or support group to help you.","Your health care provider will want to determine whether other conditions may be causing your anxiety or if you have social anxiety disorder along with another physical or mental health disorder.
Your health care provider may determine a diagnosis based on:
Physical exam to help assess whether any medical condition or medication may trigger symptoms of anxiety
Discussion of your symptoms, how often they occur and in what situations
Review of a list of situations to see if they make you anxious
Self-report questionnaires about symptoms of social anxiety
Criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association
DSM-5 criteria for social anxiety disorder include:
Persistent, intense fear or anxiety about specific social situations because you believe you may be judged negatively, embarrassed or humiliated
Avoidance of anxiety-producing social situations or enduring them with intense fear or anxiety
Excessive anxiety that's out of proportion to the situation
Anxiety or distress that interferes with your daily living
Fear or anxiety that is not better explained by a medical condition, medication or substance abuse",Treatment depends on how much social anxiety disorder affects your ability to function in daily life. The most common treatment for social anxiety disorder includes psychotherapy (also called psychological counseling or talk therapy) or medications or both.,"These coping methods may help ease your anxiety:
Routinely reach out to friends and family members.
Join a local or reputable internet-based support group.
Join a group that offers opportunities to improve communication and public speaking skills, such as Toastmasters International.
Do pleasurable or relaxing activities, such as hobbies, when you feel anxious.
Over time, these coping methods can help control your symptoms and prevent a relapse. Remind yourself that you can get through anxious moments, that your anxiety is short-lived and that the negative consequences you worry about so much rarely come to pass.","You may see your primary care provider, or your provider may refer you to a mental health professional. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.","Although social anxiety disorder generally requires help from a medical expert or qualified psychotherapist, you can try some of these techniques to handle situations that are likely to trigger symptoms:
Learn stress-reduction skills.
Get physical exercise or be physically active on a regular basis.
Get enough sleep.
Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet.
Avoid alcohol.
Limit or avoid caffeine.
Participate in social situations by reaching out to people with whom you feel comfortable.
First, consider your fears to identify what situations cause the most anxiety. Then gradually practice these activities until they cause you less anxiety. Begin with small steps by setting daily or weekly goals in situations that aren't overwhelming. The more you practice, the less anxious you'll feel.
Consider practicing these situations:
Eat with a close relative, friend or acquaintance in a public setting.
Purposefully make eye contact and return greetings from others, or be the first to say hello.
Give someone a compliment.
Ask a retail clerk to help you find an item.
Get directions from a stranger.
Show an interest in others — ask about their homes, children, grandchildren, hobbies or travels, for instance.
Call a friend to make plans.
At first, being social when you're feeling anxious is challenging. As difficult or painful as it may seem initially, don't avoid situations that trigger your symptoms. By regularly facing these kinds of situations, you'll continue to build and reinforce your coping skills.
These strategies can help you begin to face situations that make you nervous:
Prepare for conversation, for example, by reading about current events to identify interesting stories you can talk about.
Focus on personal qualities you like about yourself.
Practice relaxation exercises.
Learn stress management techniques.
Set realistic social goals.
Pay attention to how often the embarrassing situations you're afraid of actually take place. You may notice that the scenarios you fear usually don't come to pass.
When embarrassing situations do happen, remind yourself that your feelings will pass and you can handle them until they do. Most people around you either don't notice or don't care as much as you think, or they're more forgiving than you assume.
Avoid using alcohol to calm your nerves. It may seem like it helps temporarily, but in the long term it can make you feel even more anxious."
Abdominal aortic aneurysm,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20350688,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350693,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/doctors-departments/ddc-20350695,"An abdominal aortic aneurysm is an enlarged area in the lower part of the body's main artery, called the aorta. The aorta goes from the heart through the center of the chest and belly area, called the abdomen.
An abdominal aortic aneurysm that ruptures can cause life-threatening bleeding.
Treatment depends on how big the aneurysm is and how fast it's growing. Treatment may include regular health checkups and imaging tests to emergency surgery.","Abdominal aortic aneurysms often grow slowly. You might not notice any symptoms. This makes them hard to find. Many start small and stay small. Others get bigger over time, sometimes quickly. Some aneurysms never rupture.
If you have an abdominal aortic aneurysm that's getting bigger, symptoms might include:
Deep, constant pain in the belly area or side of the belly.
Back pain.
A throbbing or pulsing feeling near the belly button.","If you have pain, especially if pain is sudden and very bad, get medical help right away.","An aneurysm can grow in any part of the aorta. Most aortic aneurysms happen in the part of the aorta that's in the belly area, called the abdomen.
Things that can cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm include:
Hardening of the arteries, called atherosclerosis.Atherosclerosis occurs when fat and other substances build up in and on the artery walls.
High blood pressure.High blood pressure can damage and weaken the aorta's walls.
Blood vessel diseases.These diseases cause blood vessels to become swollen and irritated.
Infection in the aorta.Rarely, germs can infect the aorta and cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Trauma.For example, being injured in a car accident can cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm.","Abdominal aortic aneurysm risk factors include:
Tobacco use.Smoking is the strongest risk factor for aortic aneurysms. Smoking weakens the walls of blood vessels, including the aorta. This raises the risk of aortic aneurysm and aneurysm rupture. The longer and more you use tobacco, the greater the chances are of developing an aortic aneurysm. Men ages 65 to 75 who have ever smoked should have a one-time ultrasound to screen for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Age.Abdominal aortic aneurysms occur most often in people age 65 and older.
Sex.Men get abdominal aortic aneurysms much more often than women do.
Being white.People who are white are at higher risk of abdominal aortic aneurysms.
Family history.Having a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms increases the risk of having the condition.
Other aneurysms.Having an aneurysm in the aorta in the chest (thoracic aortic aneurysm) or in another large blood vessel, such as the artery behind the knee, might increase the risk of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
If you're at risk of an aortic aneurysm, medicines may be given to lower blood pressure and relieve stress on weakened arteries.","Possible complications of abdominal aortic aneurysms include:
Tears in one or more of the layers of the wall of the aorta, called an aortic dissection.
Rupture of the aneurysm.
A rupture can cause life-threatening bleeding inside the body. In general, the larger the aneurysm and the faster it grows, the greater the risk of rupture.
Symptoms that an aortic aneurysm has ruptured can include:
Sudden, very bad and long-lasting belly or back pain, which may feel like ripping or tearing.
Low blood pressure.
Fast pulse.
Aortic aneurysms also increase the risk of developing blood clots in the area. If a blood clot breaks loose, it can block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body. Symptoms of a blocked blood vessel may include pain or reduced blood flow to the legs, toes, kidneys or belly area.","To prevent an abdominal aortic aneurysm or to keep one from worsening, take these steps:
Don't smoke or use tobacco products.If you smoke or chew tobacco, quit. Also avoid secondhand smoke. If you need help quitting, talk to your healthcare team about strategies that may help.
Eat a healthy diet.Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, chicken, fish, and low-fat dairy products. Avoid saturated and trans fats and limit salt.
Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol under control.Take medicines as directed.
Get regular exercise and stay active.Try to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity. If you haven't been active, start slowly and build up. Talk to your healthcare team about what kinds of activities are right for you.","Abdominal aortic aneurysms are often found when a physical exam or imaging test is done for another reason.
To diagnose an abdominal aortic aneurysm, a healthcare professional examines you and asks questions about your medical and family history.","The goal of abdominal aortic aneurysm treatment is to prevent an aneurysm from rupturing. Treatment may involve:
Frequent health checkups and imaging, called medical monitoring or watchful waiting.
Surgery.
Which treatment you have depends on the size of the abdominal aortic aneurysm and how fast it's growing.",,"Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you are concerned about your risk of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. If you're having severe pain, get emergency medical help.
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.","Your healthcare professional may tell you to avoid heavy lifting and vigorous physical activity. These activities may cause extreme increases in blood pressure, which can make an aneurysm worse.
Emotional stress also can raise blood pressure. Try to avoid conflict and stressful situations. If you're feeling stressed or anxious, let your healthcare professional know. Together you can come up with the best treatment plan."
Coarctation of the aorta,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coarctation-of-the-aorta/symptoms-causes/syc-20352529,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coarctation-of-the-aorta/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352535,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coarctation-of-the-aorta/doctors-departments/ddc-20352537,"Aortic coarctation (ko-ahrk-TAY-shun) is a narrowing of a part of the body's main artery, called the aorta. The condition forces the heart to work harder to pump blood.
Coarctation of the aorta is usually present at birth. That means it is a congenital heart defect. But sometimes the condition can occur later in life.
Coarctation of the aorta often occurs along with other congenital heart defects. Treatment to fix the condition is usually successful. But regular health checkups are needed for life to watch for changes in the heart's health.","Symptoms of coarctation of the aorta depend on how much of the aorta is narrowed. Most people don't have symptoms.
Adults and older children with mild coarctation of the aorta may not have symptoms and their hearts may seem healthy.
If a baby is born with an extreme narrowing of the aorta, symptoms may be noticed shortly after birth. Symptoms of coarctation of the aorta in infants include:
Difficulty breathing.
Difficulty feeding.
Heavy sweating.
Irritability.
Changes in skin color.
Symptoms of coarctation of the aorta later in life may include:
Chest pain.
High blood pressure.
Headaches.
Muscle weakness.
Leg cramps.
Cold feet.
Nosebleeds.
Coarctation of the aorta often occurs with other heart conditions present at birth. Other symptoms depend on the specific types of congenital heart defects.","Get medical help right away for any chest pain that is extreme or can't be explained.
Also get medical help for these symptoms:
Fainting.
Sudden shortness of breath.
High blood pressure that can't be explained.
These symptoms can be caused by many different health conditions. A complete health checkup is needed to learn the cause.","The cause of coarctation of the aorta is unclear. It's usually a heart problem present at birth, called a congenital heart defect. A congenital heart defect happens as the baby is growing in the womb during pregnancy. The cause is often unknown.
Rarely, coarctation of the aorta can happen later in life. Conditions or events that can narrow the aorta and cause this condition include:
Traumatic injury.
An extreme buildup of cholesterols and fats in the arteries, called atherosclerosis.
A rare type of swelling and irritation of blood vessels in the heart, called Takayasu arteritis.","Risk factors for coarctation of the aorta include:
Male sex.
Some genetic conditions, such as Turner syndrome.
Some heart conditions present at birth, called congenital heart defects.
Congenital heart defects associated with coarctation of the aorta include:
Bicuspid aortic valve.The aortic valve is between the body's main artery and the lower left heart chamber. If the aortic valve has only two flaps, called cusps, instead of the usual three, it's called a bicuspid valve.
Subaortic stenosis.This is a narrowing of the area below the aortic valve. It blocks blood flow from the lower left heart chamber to the aorta.
Patent ductus arteriosus.The ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel that connects the left lung artery to the aorta. When a baby is growing in the womb, this vessel lets blood go around the lungs. Shortly after birth, the ductus arteriosus usually closes. If it stays open, the opening is called a patent ductus arteriosus.
Holes in the heart.Some people with coarctation of the aorta also are born with a hole in the heart. If the hole is between the upper heart chambers, it is called an atrial septal defect. A hole between the lower heart chambers is called a ventricular septal defect.
Congenital mitral valve stenosis.This is a type of heart valve disease that some people are born with. The valve between the upper and lower left heart chambers is narrowed. It's harder for blood to move through the valve.","Complications of coarctation of the aorta happen because the left lower heart chamber has to work harder to pump blood through the narrowed artery. This makes blood pressure go up in the lower left heart chamber. Also, the wall of the chamber can get thick. This condition is called ventricular hypertrophy.
Complications of coarctation of the aorta include:
Long-term high blood pressure. Blood pressure usually drops after surgery to fix the aorta. But it may still be higher than usual.
A weakened or bulging artery in the brain, also known as a brain aneurysm.
Bleeding in the brain.
A rupture or tear in the body's main artery, called an aortic dissection.
A bulge in the wall of the body's main artery, called an aortic aneurysm.
Coronary artery disease.
Stroke.
Prompt treatment is needed to help prevent complications. Without treatment, coarctation of the aorta may lead to:
Kidney failure.
Heart failure.
Death.
Some people have complications after treatment for coarctation of the aorta. These complications include:
Re-narrowing of the aorta, called re-coarctation.
Aortic aneurysm or rupture.
To prevent complications, people with coarctation of the aorta need regular health checkups for life.",There's no known way to prevent coarctation of the aorta. Tell your healthcare team if you have a family history of heart conditions present at birth.,"Diagnosis of aortic coarctation may depend on how severe the heart condition is. Severe aortic coarctation is usually diagnosed soon after birth. The condition may be seen on ultrasound images taken during pregnancy.
If the condition is mild, it may not be found until later in life.
To diagnose aortic coarctation, a healthcare professional checks blood pressure in the arms and legs. Depending on which part of the aorta is affected, blood pressure may be high in the arms and low in the legs and ankles. The pulse may be weak or delayed in the legs.
A whooshing sound called a heart murmur may be heard when listening to the heart.","Treatment for coarctation of the aorta depends on how old the person is when the heart condition is diagnosed. Treatment also depends on how much of the aorta is narrowed.
Coarctation of the aorta treatment may include:
Medicines.
A heart procedure.
Surgery.
If there are other congenital heart defects, they may be repaired at the same time.",,"If coarctation of the aorta is diagnosed at birth, there may not be time to prepare. If symptoms aren't noticed until later in life, see a doctor trained in heart problems present at birth. This type of healthcare professional is called a congenital cardiologist.
Here's some information to help you prepare for the appointment.","People who had coarctation of the aorta need to take steps to control blood pressure and watch for complications. Follow these tips:
Get regular exercise.Regular exercise helps lower blood pressure. Talk with your healthcare team about the amount and type of exercise that's best for you. Some physical activities, such as weight lifting, can temporarily raise blood pressure.
Talk with your healthcare team before getting pregnant.Coarctation of the aorta, even after it's fixed, may increase the risk of an aortic tear or rupture during pregnancy and childbirth. Before becoming pregnant, talk with a doctor trained in congenital heart diseases, called an adult congenital cardiologist. Together you can go over the possible risks and complications.
Prevent heart infections.Bacteria can affect the inner lining of the heart or valves, causing an infection called endocarditis. People with some heart conditions may need to take antibiotics before dental work to prevent this infection. Ask your healthcare professional whether you need preventive antibiotics."
Aortic valve regurgitation,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aortic-valve-regurgitation/symptoms-causes/syc-20353129,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aortic-valve-regurgitation/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353135,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aortic-valve-regurgitation/doctors-departments/ddc-20353137,"Aortic valve regurgitation — also called aortic regurgitation — is a type of heart valve disease. The valve between the lower left heart chamber and the body's main artery doesn't close tightly. As a result, some of the blood pumped out of the heart's main pumping chamber, called the left ventricle, leaks backward.
The leakage may prevent the heart from doing a good enough job of pumping blood to the rest of the body. You may feel tired and short of breath.
Aortic valve regurgitation can develop suddenly or over many years. Once the condition becomes severe, surgery often is needed to repair or replace the valve.","Most often, aortic valve regurgitation develops over time. You may have no symptoms for years. You might not realize that you have the condition. But sometimes, aortic valve regurgitation occurs suddenly. Usually, this is due to an infection of the valve.
As aortic valve regurgitation becomes worse, symptoms may include:
Shortness of breath with exercise or when lying down.
Tiredness and weakness, especially when being more active than usual.
Irregular heartbeat.
Lightheadedness or fainting.
Pain, discomfort or tightness in the chest, which often gets worse during exercise.
Sensations of a rapid, fluttering heartbeat, called palpitations.
Swollen ankles and feet.","Call a member of your health care team right away if you have symptoms of aortic valve regurgitation.
Sometimes the first symptoms of aortic valve regurgitation are related to heart failure. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump blood as well as it should. Make an appointment with your health care team if you have:
Tiredness, also called fatigue, that doesn't get better with rest.
Shortness of breath.
Swollen ankles and feet.
These are common symptoms of heart failure.","The aortic valve is one of four valves that control blood flow through the heart. It separates the heart's main pumping chamber, called the left ventricle, and the body's main artery, called the aorta. The aortic valve has flaps, also called cusps or leaflets, that open and close once during each heartbeat.
In aortic valve regurgitation, the valve doesn't close properly. This causes blood to leak back into the lower left heart chamber, called the left ventricle. As a result, the chamber holds more blood. This could cause it to get larger and thicken.
At first, the larger left ventricle helps maintain good blood flow with more force. But eventually, the heart becomes weak.
Any condition that damages the aortic valve can cause aortic valve regurgitation. Causes may include:
Heart valve disease present at birth.Some people are born with an aortic valve that has only two cusps, called a bicuspid valve. Others are born with connected cusps rather than the typical three separate ones. Sometimes the valve may have only one cusp, called a unicuspid valve. Other times, there are four cusps, called a quadricuspid valve.Having a parent or sibling with a bicuspid valve raises your risk of the condition. But you can have a bicuspid valve even if you don't have a family history of the condition.
Narrowing of the aortic valve, called aortic stenosis.Calcium deposits can build up on the aortic valve as you age. The buildup causes the aortic valve to stiffen and become narrow. It prevents the valve from opening properly. Aortic stenosis also may prevent the valve from closing properly.
Inflammation of the inner lining of the heart's chambers and valves.This life-threatening condition also is called endocarditis. It's usually caused by an infection. It can damage the aortic valve.
Rheumatic fever.This condition was once a common childhood illness in the United States. Strep throat can cause it. Rheumatic fever can cause the aortic valve to become stiff and narrow, in turn causing blood to leak. If you have an irregular heart valve due to rheumatic fever, it's called rheumatic heart disease.
Other health conditions.Other rare conditions can cause the aorta to get bigger and damage the aortic valve. These include a connective tissue disease called Marfan syndrome. Some immune system conditions, such as lupus, also can lead to aortic valve regurgitation.
Tear or injury of the body's main artery.The body's main artery is the aorta. A traumatic chest injury may damage the aorta and cause aortic regurgitation. So might a tear in the inner layer of the aorta, called an aortic dissection.","Things that raise the risk of aortic valve regurgitation include:
Older age.
Heart problems present at birth, also called congenital heart defects.
History of infections that can affect the heart.
Certain conditions passed down through families that can affect the heart, such as Marfan syndrome.
Other types of heart valve disease, such as aortic valve stenosis.
High blood pressure.
The condition also can happen without any known risk factors.","Complications of aortic valve regurgitation can include:
Fainting or feeling lightheaded.
Heart failure.
Certain heart infections such as endocarditis.
Heart rhythm problems, called arrhythmias.
Death.","If you have any type of heart disease, get regular health checkups.
If you have a parent, child or sibling with a bicuspid aortic valve, you should have an imaging test called an echocardiogram. This can check for aortic valve regurgitation. Early diagnosis of heart valve disease, such as aortic valve regurgitation, is important. Doing so may make the condition easier to treat.
Also, take steps to prevent conditions that can raise the risk of aortic valve regurgitation. For example:
Get a health checkup if you have a severe sore throat.Untreated strep throat can lead to rheumatic fever. Strep throat is treated with medicines that fight bacteria, called antibiotics.
Check your blood pressure regularly.Have your blood pressure checked at least every two years starting at age 18. Some people need more-frequent checks.","To diagnose aortic valve regurgitation, a member of your health care team examines you. You usually are asked questions about your symptoms and health history. You also might be asked about your family's health history.
Your blood pressure is checked using a cuff, usually placed around your arm. A device called a stethoscope is used to listen to your heart. Your health care professional may hear an irregular sound called a heart murmur.
You may be referred to a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist.","Treatment of aortic valve regurgitation depends on:
How serious the condition is.
The symptoms, if any.
Whether the condition is getting worse.
The goals of aortic valve regurgitation treatment are to ease symptoms and prevent complications.
If your symptoms are mild or you don't have symptoms, you may only need regular health checkups. You may need regular echocardiograms to check the health of the aortic valve. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes also are usually recommended.",,"If you think you might have symptoms of heart valve disease, make an appointment for a health checkup. You may be referred to a doctor trained in heart diseases. This doctor is called a cardiologist.
If you have aortic valve regurgitation, consider being cared for by a medical team that specializes in heart valve disease.
Here's some information to help you prepare for your appointment.","While lifestyle changes can't prevent or treat your condition, your health care team might suggest that you practice some heart-healthy habits. These may include:
Eat a heart-healthy diet.Enjoy a variety of fruits and vegetables, low-fat or fat-free dairy products, poultry, fish, and whole grains. Stay away from saturated and trans fats and excess salt and sugar.
Stay at a healthy weight.Aim to keep a healthy weight. If you're overweight or obese, your health care team may recommend that you lose weight. Ask what goal weight is healthy for you.
Get regular exercise.Aim to include about 30 minutes of physical activity, such as brisk walks, into your daily fitness routine. Ask your care team for advice before you start to exercise, especially if you're thinking about playing competitive sports.
Don't smoke or use tobacco.If you smoke, quit. Ask your care team about resources to help you quit smoking. Joining a support group may be helpful.
Control high blood pressure.Uncontrolled high blood pressure increases the risk of serious health problems. Get your blood pressure checked at least every two years if you're 18 or older. If you have risk factors for heart disease or are over age 40, you may need more-frequent checks.
Get a cholesterol test.Get your first cholesterol test when you're in your 20s and then another at least every 4 to 6 years. Some people may need to start testing earlier or have more-frequent checks.
Manage diabetes.If you have diabetes, tight blood sugar control can help keep your heart healthy.
Practice good sleep habits.Poor sleep may increase the risk of heart disease. Adults should aim to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep daily. Go to bed and wake at the same time every day, including on weekends. If you have trouble sleeping, talk with your health care team about strategies that might help."

It separates the heart's main pumping chamber, called the left ventricle, and the body's main artery, called the aorta. The aortic valve has flaps, also called cusps or leaflets, that open and close once during each heartbeat.
In aortic valve regurgitation, the valve doesn't close properly. This causes blood to leak back into the lower left heart chamber, called the left ventricle. As a result, the chamber holds more blood. This could cause it to get larger and thicken.
At first, the larger left ventricle helps maintain good blood flow with more force. But eventually, the heart becomes weak.
Any condition that damages the aortic valve can cause aortic valve regurgitation. Causes may include:
Heart valve disease present at birth.Some people are born with an aortic valve that has only two cusps, called a bicuspid valve. Others are born with connected cusps rather than the typical three separate ones. Sometimes the valve may have only one cusp, called a unicuspid valve. Other times, there are four cusps, called a quadricuspid valve.Having a parent or sibling with a bicuspid valve raises your risk of the condition. But you can have a bicuspid valve even if you don't have a family history of the condition.
Narrowing of the aortic valve, called aortic stenosis.Calcium deposits can build up on the aortic valve as you age. The buildup causes the aortic valve to stiffen and become narrow. It prevents the valve from opening properly. Aortic stenosis also may prevent the valve from closing properly.
Inflammation of the inner lining of the heart's chambers and valves.This life-threatening condition also is called endocarditis. It's usually caused by an infection. It can damage the aortic valve.
Rheumatic fever.This condition was once a common childhood illness in the United States. Strep throat can cause it. Rheumatic fever can cause the aortic valve to become stiff and narrow, in turn causing blood to leak. If you have an irregular heart valve due to rheumatic fever, it's called rheumatic heart disease.
Other health conditions.Other rare conditions can cause the aorta to get bigger and damage the aortic valve. These include a connective tissue disease called Marfan syndrome. Some immune system conditions, such as lupus, also can lead to aortic valve regurgitation.
Tear or injury of the body's main artery.The body's main artery is the aorta. A traumatic chest injury may damage the aorta and cause aortic regurgitation. So might a tear in the inner layer of the aorta, called an aortic dissection.","Things that raise the risk of aortic valve regurgitation include:
Older age.
Heart problems present at birth, also called congenital heart defects.
History of infections that can affect the heart.
Certain conditions passed down through families that can affect the heart, such as Marfan syndrome.
Other types of heart valve disease, such as aortic valve stenosis.
High blood pressure.
The condition also can happen without any known risk factors.","Complications of aortic valve regurgitation can include:
Fainting or feeling lightheaded.
Heart failure.
Certain heart infections such as endocarditis.
Heart rhythm problems, called arrhythmias.
Death.","If you have any type of heart disease, get regular health checkups.
If you have a parent, child or sibling with a bicuspid aortic valve, you should have an imaging test called an echocardiogram. This can check for aortic valve regurgitation. Early diagnosis of heart valve disease, such as aortic valve regurgitation, is important. Doing so may make the condition easier to treat.
Also, take steps to prevent conditions that can raise the risk of aortic valve regurgitation. For example:
Get a health checkup if you have a severe sore throat.Untreated strep throat can lead to rheumatic fever. Strep throat is treated with medicines that fight bacteria, called antibiotics.
Check your blood pressure regularly.Have your blood pressure checked at least every two years starting at age 18. Some people need more-frequent checks.","To diagnose aortic valve regurgitation, a member of your health care team examines you. You usually are asked questions about your symptoms and health history. You also might be asked about your family's health history.
Your blood pressure is checked using a cuff, usually placed around your arm. A device called a stethoscope is used to listen to your heart. Your health care professional may hear an irregular sound called a heart murmur.
You may be referred to a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist.","Treatment of aortic valve regurgitation depends on:
How serious the condition is.
The symptoms, if any.
Whether the condition is getting worse.
The goals of aortic valve regurgitation treatment are to ease symptoms and prevent complications.
If your symptoms are mild or you don't have symptoms, you may only need regular health checkups. You may need regular echocardiograms to check the health of the aortic valve. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes also are usually recommended.",,"If you think you might have symptoms of heart valve disease, make an appointment for a health checkup. You may be referred to a doctor trained in heart diseases. This doctor is called a cardiologist.
If you have aortic valve regurgitation, consider being cared for by a medical team that specializes in heart valve disease.
Here's some information to help you prepare for your appointment.","While lifestyle changes can't prevent or treat your condition, your health care team might suggest that you practice some heart-healthy habits. These may include:
Eat a heart-healthy diet.Enjoy a variety of fruits and vegetables, low-fat or fat-free dairy products, poultry, fish, and whole grains. Stay away from saturated and trans fats and excess salt and sugar.
Stay at a healthy weight.Aim to keep a healthy weight. If you're overweight or obese, your health care team may recommend that you lose weight. Ask what goal weight is healthy for you.
Get regular exercise.Aim to include about 30 minutes of physical activity, such as brisk walks, into your daily fitness routine. Ask your care team for advice before you start to exercise, especially if you're thinking about playing competitive sports.
Don't smoke or use tobacco.If you smoke, quit. Ask your care team about resources to help you quit smoking. Joining a support group may be helpful.
Control high blood pressure.Uncontrolled high blood pressure increases the risk of serious health problems. Get your blood pressure checked at least every two years if you're 18 or older. If you have risk factors for heart disease or are over age 40, you may need more-frequent checks.
Get a cholesterol test.Get your first cholesterol test when you're in your 20s and then another at least every 4 to 6 years. Some people may need to start testing earlier or have more-frequent checks.
Manage diabetes.If you have diabetes, tight blood sugar control can help keep your heart healthy.
Practice good sleep habits.Poor sleep may increase the risk of heart disease. Adults should aim to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep daily. Go to bed and wake at the same time every day, including on weekends. If you have trouble sleeping, talk with your health care team about strategies that might help."
Auditory processing disorder,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/auditory-processing-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20555261,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/auditory-processing-disorder/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20555277,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/auditory-processing-disorder/doctors-departments/ddc-20555296,"Auditory processing disorder, also called APD, is a type of hearing loss caused by something affecting the part of the brain that processes how you hear. Ear damage causes other types of hearing loss.
APDis also sometimes called central auditory processing disorder (CAPD). It can happen in anyone. But it most often happens in children and older adults.
Many conditions can affect how well a person understands what they hear, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism. But these conditions are different from auditory processing disorder, although they can appear withAPD.APDalso can happen with other types of hearing loss.
Auditory processing disorder has no cure. But treatments can help you hear better.","Symptoms of auditory processing disorder (APD) can be subtle. Symptoms can include having trouble with:
Telling where sound is coming from.
Understanding words that are spoken quickly or in a noisy room.
Paying attention.
Reading and spelling.
Following directions unless they are short and simple.
Learning a new language.
Singing or enjoying music.
Understanding and remembering spoken information.
If you haveAPD, you also might:
Take longer to reply to someone who is talking to you.
Often need others to repeat themselves.
Not understand sarcasm or jokes.
APDis often seen with attention, language and learning issues like those seen in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.","If you have trouble hearing or understanding what you hear, talk to a health care professional.","The cause of auditory processing disorder (APD) is sometimes unknown.APDcan be linked to many conditions. In older adults, conditions might include stroke and head trauma. In children,APDcan be linked to issues at birth, such as low birth weight or early birth, or repeated ear infections.
In typical hearing, the brain's auditory center takes the sound waves sent from the ears and turns them into sounds you know. But with auditory processing disorder (APD), the auditory part of the brain can't do this.","Factors that increase your risk of auditory processing disorder (APD) include:
Aging.
Stroke.
Head trauma.
Lead poisoning.
Seizure disorders.
Issues linked to birth, such as an early birth, low birth weight or a pregnant person using alcohol, drugs or tobacco.
Repeated ear infections, especially at a young age.","Auditory processing disorder (APD) complications include:
Trouble understanding what people are saying.
Trouble taking part in activities.
Feeling isolated and lonely.
Trouble reading and writing, in children.
Trouble doing well in school.
Feeling depressed.",,"To diagnose auditory processing disorder (APD), your health care team may ask questions about your symptoms and how long you have had them, as well as order tests.
Several specialists on your health care team might help diagnose you or your child with auditory processing disorder (APD). For children, the team might include teachers, who look at learning and attention issues. For children and adults, the team might include mental health professionals, called psychologists, who look at how the mind works. And speech-language pathologists can look at the use of language.
A hearing specialist called an audiologist may do tests to see what is happening when you or your child hear sounds. These tests might include:
Tympanometry.This test can tell if the eardrum isn't moving well. The eardrum needs to move for good hearing. For this test, the audiologist places a soft probe in the ear canal. Then they send small bits of air pressure toward the ear. The probe measures how much the eardrum moves in response to the air.
Acoustic reflex test.This test shows what happens in the ear when it hears a loud sound.
Auditory brainstem response.This test shows how well the inner ear, called the cochlea, and the brain pathways for hearing are working. An audiologist places sensors around the ear and on the head. The sensors connect to a computer.Short clicking sounds come through headphones worn during the test. The computer records how the nerves between the ears and the brain respond to the sounds.
Evoked potential test.This test shows how well sound travels along the nerves that connect the ears to the brain. For this test, an audiologist places sensors on the head. The sensors connect to a computer. Short clicking sounds come through headphones worn during the test.This lets an audiologist see how well sound gets to different parts of the brain. It also shows if anything is blocking the nerves that link the ears to the brain.","Not everyone with auditory processing disorder (APD) needs treatment. If you or your child need treatment, there are many approaches. Every person withAPDhas different needs. Your health care team can work with you to help you. Your or your child's treatment might include:
Hearing aids and listening devices.Your health care team may suggest that you use hearing aids with wireless listening devices. Listening devices help direct sound to you. They get sound from the source to your hearing aid.Frequency modulated, or FM, systems send sounds to you so you can hear them better. They work with a hearing aid and direct sounds to it. These systems help make it easier to hear sounds in noisy environments.
Auditory training.Auditory training,also called hearing rehabilitation, helps you adjust to hearing loss. You may train with an audiologist, a speech-language pathologist or both. You may train one-on-one with a therapist or as part of a group.During auditory training, you learn to tell one type of sound from another. You do this by listening to sounds that are louder and softer, given quickly and slowly. Sounds come from different directions. You also learn to tell the difference between speech sounds, which affects the meaning of the words you hear.Auditory training helps the brain tell the difference between the many sounds you hear every day. The goal is to help you feel like you're able to talk with others more.
Computer-based training.Computer-based programs can help train the brain to recognize and understand sounds. These programs are like auditory training, but you do them online or with a computer program.","Having auditory processing disorder (APD) can make you feel left out of everyday events. It can make you feel lonely. Auditory training as part of your treatment may help you or your child learn how to cope with hearing loss and adjust to it.
Auditory training might help you or your child learn to talk to others better and help them talk to you. This can help you feel less alone and more connected to others.","You or your child might start by seeing your family health care professional. For testing, you or your child might be referred to a specialist in hearing, called an audiologist.
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.","There are simple steps you can take to manage auditory processing disorder (APD). For instance:
Try using a remote microphone to improve how well you can hear in a noisy room.
Move closer to the person who is speaking.
Think about covering surfaces that make sounds echo, such as open or empty spaces.
Move away from other sources of noise, such as a fan.
In a class or at a meeting, ask someone to take notes for you or get a written copy of what was said.
Ask for anything important to be in writing.
Use subtitles when watching TV."
Primary progressive aphasia,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/primary-progressive-aphasia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350499,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/primary-progressive-aphasia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350504,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/primary-progressive-aphasia/doctors-departments/ddc-20350506,"Primary progressive aphasia (uh-FAY-zhuh) is a rare nervous system condition that affects a person's ability to communicate. People who have primary progressive aphasia can have trouble expressing their thoughts and understanding or finding words.
Symptoms develop gradually, often before age 65. They get worse over time. People with primary progressive aphasia can lose the ability to speak and write. Eventually they're not able to understand written or spoken language.
This condition progresses slowly. People who have primary progressive aphasia may continue caring for themselves and participating in daily activities for several years.
Primary progressive aphasia is a type of frontotemporal dementia. Frontotemporal dementia is a cluster of conditions that result from the degeneration of the frontal or temporal lobes of the brain. These areas include brain tissue involved in speech and language. Not all people with primary progressive aphasia have dementia, but most develop it. The term ""dementia"" is typically not used until a person can't do things alone due to changes in their thinking and understanding.",Primary progressive aphasia symptoms vary based on which part of the brain's language areas are involved. The condition has three types. Each type causes different symptoms. Symptoms develop over time and gradually get worse.,"See your healthcare professional if you have concerns about your ability to communicate. If you have a family member or friend who has symptoms of primary progressive aphasia, talk to the person about your concerns. Offer to go with the person to see a healthcare professional.
If changes in speech or communication come on suddenly, call 911 or your local emergency number.","Primary progressive aphasia is caused by a shrinking of certain areas of the brain, known as lobes. In primary progressive aphasia, the frontal, temporal or parietal lobes are affected. When areas of the brain shrink, it's called atrophy. The atrophy caused by primary progressive aphasia mainly happens on the left side of the brain. The areas affected are responsible for speech and language.
Atrophy is linked to the presence of certain proteins in the brain. The proteins may reduce brain activity or function.","Risk factors for primary progressive aphasia include:
Learning disabilities.People who had a childhood learning disability such as dyslexia may have a higher risk of developing primary progressive aphasia.
Certain gene changes.Although primary progressive aphasia most often happens randomly, rare gene changes have been linked to the condition. If other members of your family have had primary progressive aphasia, consider genetic testing to see if you are more likely to develop it.","People with primary progressive aphasia eventually lose the ability to speak and write. This may take anywhere from 3 to 15 years. People with the condition also have trouble understanding written and spoken language.
As the disease progresses, other mental skills such as memory, planning and organizing can be affected. Some people develop other symptoms such as problems with movement, balance and swallowing. With these complications, people with the disease eventually need help with day-to-day care.
People with primary progressive aphasia also can develop depression as the disease progresses. Other complications might include blunted emotions such as not showing concern, poor judgment or social behavior that's not appropriate.","There is no known way to prevent primary progressive aphasia. However, you can keep your brain healthy by using GROWTH:
Get quality sleep.
Reduce stress.
Open connections.
Work out.
Try new things.
Healthy eating.","To diagnose primary progressive aphasia, a neurologist or speech and language pathologist will likely review your symptoms and order tests.
Communication troubles that get worse without significant changes in thinking and behavior for 2 to 3 years are a hallmark of primary progressive aphasia.
Tests and procedures used to diagnose primary progressive aphasia may include:","Primary progressive aphasia can't be cured, and there are no medicines to treat it. However, some therapies might help improve or maintain your ability to communicate and manage your condition.","Losing the ability to communicate can be stressful and frustrating. This is true for both the person with primary progressive aphasia and for friends and family. If you're a caregiver of someone with primary progressive aphasia, taking these steps can help everyone cope:
Learn all you can about the condition.
Have the person with the condition carry an identification card and other materials that can help explain the condition to others.
Give the person time to talk.
Speak slowly in simple, adult sentences and listen carefully.
Talk with the person with the condition about how you can help.
Take care of your personal needs. Get enough rest and make time for social activities.
Family members eventually may need to make long-term care choices for the person with primary progressive aphasia. They also may need to plan the person's finances and help make legal decisions to prepare for more-serious stages of the condition. Start this process early so the person with primary progressive aphasia can be involved.
Support groups may be offered for caregivers and people with primary progressive aphasia or related conditions. Ask your social worker or other members of your healthcare team about community resources or support groups. Other sources of information include the National Aphasia Association and the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration.","If you're experiencing symptoms, you might start by seeing your primary healthcare professional. This person may refer you to a doctor trained in brain and nervous system conditions, known as a neurologist. You also may be referred to a speech-language pathologist.",

Most canker sores go away on their own in a week or two. Check with your doctor or dentist if you have unusually large or painful canker sores or canker sores that don't seem to heal.","Most canker sores are round or oval with a white or yellow center and a red border. They form inside your mouth — on or under your tongue, inside your cheeks or lips, at the base of your gums, or on your soft palate. You might notice a tingling or burning sensation a day or two before the sores actually appear.
There are several types of canker sores, including minor, major and herpetiform sores.","Consult your doctor if you experience:
Unusually large canker sores
Recurring sores, with new ones developing before old ones heal, or frequent outbreaks
Persistent sores, lasting two weeks or more

A minor injury to your mouth from dental work, overzealous brushing, sports mishaps or an accidental cheek bite
Toothpastes and mouth rinses containing sodium lauryl sulfate
Food sensitivities, particularly to chocolate, coffee, strawberries, eggs, nuts, cheese, and spicy or acidic foods
A diet lacking in vitamin B-12, zinc, folate (folic acid) or iron
An allergic response to certain bacteria in your mouth
Helicobacter pylori, the same bacteria that cause peptic ulcers
Hormonal shifts during menstruation
Emotional stress

Celiac disease, a serious intestinal disorder caused by a sensitivity to gluten, a protein found in most grains
Inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
Behcet's disease, a rare disorder that causes inflammation throughout the body, including the mouth
A faulty immune system that attacks healthy cells in your mouth instead of pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria
HIV/AIDS, which suppresses the immune system

Broken heart syndrome,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-heart-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20354617,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-heart-syndrome/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354623,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-heart-syndrome/doctors-departments/ddc-20354624,"Broken heart syndrome is a heart condition that's often brought on by stressful situations and extreme emotions. The condition also can be triggered by a serious physical illness or surgery. Broken heart syndrome is usually temporary. But some people may continue to feel unwell after the heart is healed.
People with broken heart syndrome may have sudden chest pain or think they're having a heart attack. Broken heart syndrome affects just part of the heart. It briefly interrupts the way the heart pumps blood. The rest of the heart continues to work as usual. Sometimes the heart contracts more forcefully.
Medicines are used to treat symptoms of broken heart syndrome.
Broken heart syndrome also may be called:
Stress cardiomyopathy.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Recurrent takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Apical ballooning syndrome.","Symptoms of broken heart syndrome can mimic those of a heart attack. Symptoms may include:
Chest pain.
Shortness of breath.",Any continued chest pain could be due to a heart attack. Call 911 or your local emergency number if you have new or unexplained chest pain. Also call if you have a very rapid or irregular heartbeat or shortness of breath.,"The exact cause of broken heart syndrome is unclear. It's thought that a surge of stress hormones, such as adrenaline, might damage the hearts of some people for a short time. How these hormones might hurt the heart or whether something else is the cause isn't completely clear.
A temporary squeezing of the large or small arteries of the heart may play a role in the development of broken heart syndrome. People who have broken heart syndrome also may have a change in the structure of the heart muscle.
An intense physical or emotional event often comes before broken heart syndrome. Anything that causes a strong emotional reaction may trigger the condition. Examples include:
Sudden illness such as an asthma attack orCOVID-19.
Major surgery.
Sudden broken bone.
Death of a loved one or other loss.
Strong argument.
Rarely, use of certain medicines or illegal drugs may lead to broken heart syndrome. They include:
Emergency medicines used to treat severe allergic reactions or severe asthma attacks.
Some medicines used to treat anxiety.
Medicines used to treat a stuffy nose.
Illegal stimulant drugs, such as methamphetamine and cocaine.
Always tell your healthcare team about the medicines you take, including those bought without a prescription. When starting a new medicine, talk to your care team about the potential risks and side effects.","Risk factors for broken heart syndrome include:
Sex.Broken heart syndrome is more common in women than in men.
Age.Most people who have broken heart syndrome are older than 50.
Mental health conditions.People who have had or have anxiety or depression may have a higher risk of broken heart syndrome.","Most people who have broken heart syndrome quickly recover and usually don't have long-lasting effects. But sometimes the condition comes back. This is called recurrent takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Rarely, broken heart syndrome can cause death.
Complications of broken heart syndrome include:
Backup of fluid into the lungs, called pulmonary edema.
Low blood pressure.
Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias.
Heart failure.
Blood clots in the heart.","To prevent another episode of broken heart syndrome, many healthcare professionals recommend long-term treatment with beta blockers or similar medicines. These medicines block the potentially harmful effects of stress hormones on the heart.
Having chronic stress may increase the risk of broken heart syndrome. Taking steps to manage emotional stress can improve heart health and may help prevent broken heart syndrome. Some ways to reduce and manage stress include:
Get more exercise.

To diagnose broken heart syndrome, a healthcare professional examines you and asks questions about your symptoms and medical history. You may be asked if you've had any major stresses recently, such as the death of a loved one.
People who have broken heart syndrome usually don't have any heart disease symptoms before the condition is diagnosed.
Tests to help diagnose broken heart syndrome include:
Blood tests.People who have broken heart syndrome often have higher levels of substances called cardiac enzymes in the blood.
Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG).This quick test measures the electrical activity of the heart. Sticky patches called electrodes are placed on the chest and sometimes the arms and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a computer, which shows the test results.AnECGshows how fast or how slow the heart is beating.ECGresults for broken heart syndrome look different from those for a heart attack.
Coronary angiogram.This test checks for blockages in the heart arteries. It's done to rule out a heart attack. People with broken heart syndrome often don't have any blockages. A doctor inserts a long, thin flexible tube called a catheter into a blood vessel, usually in the groin or wrist. It's guided to the heart. Dye flows through the catheter to arteries in the heart. The dye helps the arteries show up more clearly on X-ray images and video.Once it's clear that you're not having a heart attack, your doctor checks to see if your symptoms are caused by broken heart syndrome.
Echocardiogram.This test uses sound waves to create pictures of the beating heart. It shows how blood flows through the heart and heart valves. It can see if the heart is enlarged or has an unusual shape. These changes may be due to broken heart syndrome.
CardiacMRI.This test uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the heart.","There's no standard treatment for broken heart syndrome. Treatment is similar to heart attack care until the diagnosis is clear. Most people stay in the hospital while they get better.
Many people with broken heart syndrome are fully recovered within a month or so. An echocardiogram is done about 4 to 6 weeks after the first symptoms to make sure the heart is working better. Sometimes, broken heart syndrome happens again after treatment.",,"Broken heart syndrome is usually diagnosed in an emergency or a hospital setting.
If possible, have a family member or friend come with you to the hospital. Someone who goes with you can help you remember the information you're given.
If possible, share important information with the person taking you to the hospital:
Any symptoms you're having,and how long you've had them.
Your important personal information,including any major stresses, such as the death of a loved one, or recent life changes, such as the loss of a job.
Your personal and family medical history,including health conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol or heart disease.
A list of the medicinesyou take, including those bought without a prescription.
Any recent injury to your chestthat may have caused damage inside the body, such as a broken rib or pinched nerve.
At the hospital, you may have many questions. If possible, you may want to ask:
What do you think is causing my symptoms?
I recently experienced the sudden death of a loved one. Could my symptoms be due to this event?
What kinds of tests do I need?
Do I need to stay in the hospital?
What treatments do I need right now?
What are the risks associated with these treatments?
Will this happen again?
Do I have any diet or activity restrictions?
Don't hesitate to ask any additional questions.",

These antibodies can cause blood clots to form in arteries and veins.

Blood clots can form in the legs, lungs and other organs, such as the kidneys and spleen. The clots can lead to a heart attack, strokes and other conditions. During pregnancy, antiphospholipid syndrome also can result in miscarriage and stillbirth. Some people who have the syndrome have no signs or symptoms.

There's no cure for this uncommon condition, but medications can reduce the risk of blood clots and miscarriage.","Signs and symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome can include:

Less common signs and symptoms include:","Contact your health care provider if you have unexplained bleeding from your nose or gums; an unusually heavy menstrual period; vomit that is bright red or looks like coffee grounds; black, tarry stool or bright red stool; or unexplained abdominal pain.

Seek emergency care if you have signs and symptoms of:","Antiphospholipid syndrome occurs when the immune system mistakenly produces antibodies that make blood much more likely to clot. Antibodies usually protect the body against invaders, such as viruses and bacteria.

Antiphospholipid syndrome can be caused by an underlying condition, such as an autoimmune disorder. You can also develop the syndrome without an underlying cause.","Antiphospholipid syndrome is more common in women than in men. Having another autoimmune condition, such as lupus, increases the risk of antiphospholipid syndrome.

It's possible to have the antibodies associated with antiphospholipid syndrome without developing signs or symptoms. However, having these antibodies increases your risk of developing blood clots, particularly if you:","Complications of antiphospholipid syndrome can include:

Rarely, in severe cases, antiphospholipid syndrome can lead to multiple organ damage in a short time.",,"If you've had episodes of blood clots or pregnancy loss that aren't explained by known health conditions, your health care provider can schedule blood tests to check for clotting and for the presence of the antibodies associated with antiphospholipid syndrome.

To confirm a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome, the antibodies must appear in your blood at least twice, in tests conducted 12 or more weeks apart.

You can have antiphospholipid antibodies and never develop signs or symptoms. A diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome is made only when these antibodies cause health problems.","If you have blood clots, standard initial treatment involves a combination of blood-thinning medications. The most common are heparin and warfarin (Jantoven). Heparin is fast-acting and delivered via injections. Warfarin comes in pill form and takes several days to take effect. Aspirin is also a blood thinner.

When you're taking blood thinners, you have an increased risk of bleeding episodes. Your doctor will monitor your dosage with blood tests to be sure your blood is capable of clotting enough to stop the bleeding of a cut or the bleeding under the skin from a bruise.

There is some evidence that other drugs might be helpful in treating antiphospholipid syndrome. These include hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), rituximab (Rituxan) and statins. More study is needed.",,"In most cases, complications of antiphospholipid syndrome — such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stroke or pregnancy loss — will prompt you to seek medical care.

Broken arm,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-arm/symptoms-causes/syc-20353260,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-arm/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353266,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-arm/doctors-departments/ddc-20353267,"A broken arm involves one or more of the three bones in your arm — the ulna, radius and humerus. One of the most common causes of a broken arm is falling onto an outstretched hand. If you think you or your child has broken an arm, seek prompt medical attention. It's important to treat a fracture as soon as possible for proper healing.
Treatment depends on the site and severity of the injury. A simple break might be treated with a sling, ice and rest. However, the bone may require realignment (reduction) in the emergency room.
A more complicated break might require surgery to realign the broken bone and to implant wires, plates, nails or screws to keep the bone in place during healing.","A snap or cracking sound might be your first indication you've broken an arm. Signs and symptoms include:
Severe pain, which might increase with movement
Swelling
Bruising
Deformity, such as a bent arm or wrist
Inability to turn your arm from palm up to palm down or vice versa","If you have enough pain in your arm that you can't use it normally, see a doctor right away. The same applies to your child. Delays in diagnosis and treatment of a broken arm, especially for children, who heal faster than adults do, can lead to poor healing.","Common causes for a broken arm include:
Falls.Falling onto an outstretched hand or elbow is the most common cause of a broken arm.
Sports injuries.Direct blows and injuries on the field or court cause all types of arm fractures.
Significant trauma.Any of your arm bones can break during a car accident, bike accident or other direct trauma.
Child abuse.In children, a broken arm might be the result of child abuse.",Certain medical conditions or physical activities can increase the risk of a broken arm.,"The prognosis for most arm fractures is very good if treated early. But complications can include:
Uneven growth.Because a child's arm bones are still growing, a fracture in the area where growth occurs near each end of a long bone (growth plate) can interfere with that bone's growth.
Osteoarthritis.Fractures that extend into a joint can cause arthritis there years later.
Stiffness.The immobilization required to heal a fracture in the upper arm bone can sometimes result in painfully limited range of motion of the elbow or shoulder.
Bone infection.If a part of your broken bone protrudes through your skin, it can be exposed to germs that can cause infection. Prompt treatment of this type of fracture is critical.
Nerve or blood vessel injury.If the upper arm bone (humerus) fractures into two or more pieces, the jagged ends can injure nearby nerves and blood vessels. Seek immediate medical attention if you notice numbness or circulation problems.
Compartment syndrome.Excessive swelling of the injured arm can cut off the blood supply to part of the arm, causing pain and numbness. Typically occurring 24 to 48 hours after the injury, compartment syndrome is a medical emergency that requires surgery.","Although it's impossible to prevent an accident, these tips might offer some protection against bone breakage.
Eat for bone strength.Eat a healthy diet that includes calcium-rich foods, such as milk, yogurt and cheese, and vitamin D, which helps your body absorb calcium. You can get vitamin D from fatty fish, such as salmon; from fortified foods, such as milk and orange juice; and from sun exposure.
Exercise for bone strength.Weight-bearing physical activity and exercises that improve balance and posture can strengthen bones and reduce the chance of a fracture. The more active and fit you are as you age, the less likely you are to fall and break a bone.
Prevent falls.To prevent falling, wear sensible shoes. Remove home hazards that can cause you to trip, such as area rugs. Make sure your living space is well lit. Install grab bars in your bathroom and handrails on your stairways, if necessary.
Use protective gear.Wear wrist guards for high-risk activities, such as in-line skating, snowboarding, rugby and football.
Don't smoke.Smoking can increase your risk of a broken arm by reducing bone mass. It also hampers healing of fractures.","Your doctor will examine your arm for tenderness, swelling, deformity or an open wound. After discussing your symptoms and how you injured yourself, your doctor likely will order X-rays to determine the location and extent of the break. Occasionally, another scan, such as anMRI, might be used to get more-detailed images.","Treatment of a broken arm depends on the type of break. The time needed for healing depends on a variety of factors, including severity of the injury; other conditions, such as diabetes; your age; nutrition; and tobacco and alcohol use.
Fractures are classified into one or more of the following categories:
Open (compound) fracture.The broken bone pierces the skin, a serious condition that requires immediate, aggressive treatment to decrease the risk of infection.
Closed fracture.The skin remains unbroken.
Displaced fracture.The bone fragments on each side of the break aren't aligned. Surgery might be required to realign the fragments.
Comminuted fracture.The bone is broken into pieces, so it might require surgery.
Greenstick fracture.The bone cracks but doesn't break all the way — like what happens when you bend a green stick of wood. Most broken bones in children are greenstick fractures because children's bones are softer and more flexible than are those of adults.
Buckle (torus) fracture.One side of the bone is compressed, which causes the other side to bend (buckle). This type of fracture is also more common in children.",,"Depending on the severity of the break, your family doctor or the emergency room physician might refer you or your child to a doctor who specializes in injuries of the body's musculoskeletal system (orthopedic surgeon).",
Chiari malformation,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chiari-malformation/symptoms-causes/syc-20354010,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chiari-malformation/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354015,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chiari-malformation/doctors-departments/ddc-20354016,"Chiari malformation (kee-AH-ree mal-for-MAY-shun) is a condition in which brain tissue extends into the spinal canal. It occurs when part of the skull is misshapen or smaller than is typical. The skull presses on the brain and forces it downward.
Chiari malformation is not common, but increased use of imaging tests has led to more diagnoses.
Health care professionals group Chiari malformation into three types. The type depends on the anatomy of the brain tissue that is pushed into the spinal canal. The type also depends on whether there are developmental changes of the brain or spine.
Chiari malformation type 1 develops as the skull and brain are growing. Symptoms may not occur until late childhood or adulthood. The pediatric forms of Chiari malformation are type 2 and type 3. These types are present at birth, which is known as congenital.
Treatment of Chiari malformation depends on the type and the symptoms. Regular monitoring, medicines and surgery are treatment options. Sometimes no treatment is needed.","Many people with Chiari malformation have no symptoms and don't need treatment. They learn they have Chiari malformation only when tests are performed for unrelated conditions. But some types of Chiari malfunction can cause symptoms.
The more common types of Chiari malformation are:
Type 1
Type 2
These types are less serious than the rarer pediatric form, type 3. But symptoms still can disrupt life.","See a health care professional if you or your child has any of the symptoms that may be associated with Chiari malformation.
Many symptoms of Chiari malformation also can be caused by other conditions. A full medical evaluation is important.","Chiari malformation type 1 occurs when part of the skull is too small or is misshapen. This part of the skull contains the area of the brain called the cerebellum. The skull puts pressure on and crowds the brain. As a result, the lower part of the cerebellum known as the tonsils are pushed into the upper spinal canal.
Chiari malformation type 2 is nearly always associated with a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele.
When the cerebellum is pushed into the upper spinal canal, it can interfere with the usual flow of cerebrospinal fluid that protects the brain and spinal cord. Cerebrospinal fluid can build up in the brain or spinal cord. Or it can cause signals transmitted from the brain to the body to be blocked.
Also, the pressure from the cerebellum on the spinal cord or lower brainstem can cause symptoms.","There's evidence that Chiari malformation runs in some families. However, research into a possible hereditary component is still in its early phase.","In some people, Chiari malformation may have no symptoms and they don't need treatment. In others, Chiari malformation gets worse over time and leads to serious complications. Complications may include:
Hydrocephalus.Hydrocephalus occurs when too much fluid builds up in the brain. This can cause trouble with thinking. People with hydrocephalus may need a flexible tube called a shunt placed. The shunt diverts and drains excess cerebrospinal fluid to a different area of the body.
Spina bifida.Spina bifida is a condition in which the spinal cord or its covering isn't fully developed. Part of the spinal cord is exposed, which can cause serious conditions such as paralysis. People with Chiari malformation type 2 usually have a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele.
Syringomyelia.Some people with Chiari malformation also develop a condition called syringomyelia. In people with this condition, a cavity or cyst called a syrinx forms within the spinal column. As the syrinx grows, it can press on the nerves and cause pain, weakness and stiffness.
Tethered cord syndrome.In this condition, the spinal cord attaches to the spine and causes the spinal cord to stretch. This can cause serious nerve and muscle damage in the lower body.",,"To diagnose Chiari malformation, your health care professional reviews your medical history and symptoms and does a physical exam.
Imaging tests can help diagnose the condition and determine its cause. Tests may include:
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).AnMRIis often used to diagnose Chiari malformation. AnMRIuses powerful radio waves and magnets to create a detailed view of the body.This safe, painless test produces detailed3Dimages of structural differences in the brain that may be contributing to symptoms. It also can provide images of the cerebellum and determine whether it extends into the spinal canal.AnMRIcan be repeated over time, and it can be used to monitor the condition.
Computerized tomography (CT) scan.The health care professional may recommend other imaging tests such as aCTscan.ACTscan uses X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of the body. This can help to reveal brain tumors, brain damage, bone and blood vessel problems, and other conditions.","Treatment for Chiari malformation depends on your condition. If you have no symptoms, your health care professional may recommend no treatment other than monitoring with regular exams andMRIs.
When headaches or other types of pain are the primary symptom, your health care professional may recommend pain medicine.",,"You're likely to start by seeing your health care professional.

A heart arrhythmia occurs when the electrical signals that tell the heart to beat don't work properly. The heart may beat too fast or too slow. Or the pattern of the heartbeat may be inconsistent.
A heart arrhythmia may feel like a fluttering, pounding or racing heartbeat. Some heart arrhythmias are harmless. Others may cause life-threatening symptoms.
There are times when it is OK to have a fast or slow heartbeat. For example, the heart may beat faster with exercise or slow down during sleep.
Heart arrhythmia treatment may include medicines, devices such as pacemakers, or a procedure or surgery. The goals of treatment are to control or get rid of fast, slow or otherwise irregular heartbeats. A heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent heart damage that can trigger some heart arrhythmias.","A heart arrhythmia may not cause any symptoms. The irregular heartbeat may be noticed during a health checkup for another reason.
Symptoms of an arrhythmia may include:
A fluttering, pounding or racing feeling in the chest.
A fast heartbeat.
A slow heartbeat.
Chest pain.
Shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include:
Anxiety.
Feeling very tired.
Lightheadedness or dizziness.
Sweating.
Fainting or almost fainting.","If you feel like your heart is beating too fast or too slow, or it's skipping a beat, make an appointment for a health checkup. You may be told to see a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist.
Get emergency medical care if you have these heart symptoms:
Chest pain.
Shortness of breath.
Fainting.
Always call 911 or your local emergency number if you think you might be having a heart attack.
A type of arrhythmia called ventricular fibrillation can cause a dramatic drop in blood pressure. This can cause the person to fall to the ground within seconds, also called collapse. Soon the person's breathing and pulse will stop. Ventricular fibrillation is an emergency that needs immediate medical help. It's the most frequent cause of sudden cardiac death.
If this happens, follow these steps:
Call 911 or your local emergency number.
If there's no one nearby trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), provide hands-onlyCPR. Push hard and fast on the center of the chest. Do 100 to 120 compressions a minute until medical help arrives. You do not need to breathe into the person's mouth.
CPRhelps keep blood flowing to the organs until an electrical shock can be given with an automated external defibrillator (AED). AnAEDis a device that delivers a shock to restart the heart.
If anAEDis available nearby, have someone get the device and follow the instructions. No training is required to use it. The device tells you what to do. It's programmed to allow a shock only when appropriate.","To understand the cause of heart arrhythmias, it may help to know how the heart works.","Things that may increase the risk of heart arrhythmias include:
Coronary artery disease, other heart problems and previous heart surgery.Narrowed heart arteries, a heart attack, heart valve disease, prior heart surgery, heart failure, cardiomyopathy and other heart damage are risk factors for almost any kind of arrhythmia.
High blood pressure.This condition increases the risk of developing coronary artery disease. It also may cause the walls of the left lower heart chamber to become stiff and thick, which can change how electrical signals travel through the heart.
Heart problems present at birth.Also called congenital heart defects, some of these problems may affect the heart rate and rhythm.
Thyroid disease.Having an overactive or underactive thyroid gland can raise the risk of irregular heartbeats.
Obstructive sleep apnea.This condition causes pauses in breathing during sleep. It can lead to a slow heartbeat and irregular heartbeats, including atrial fibrillation.
Electrolyte imbalance.Substances in the blood called electrolytes help trigger and send electrical signals in the heart. Potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium are examples of electrolytes. If the body's electrolytes are too low or too high, it may interfere with heart signaling and lead to irregular heartbeats.
Some medicines and supplements.Some prescription medicines and certain cough and cold treatments can cause arrhythmias.
Excessive alcohol use.Drinking too much alcohol can affect electrical signaling in the heart. This can increase the chance of developing atrial fibrillation.
Caffeine, nicotine or illegal drug use.Stimulants can cause the heart to beat faster and may lead to the development of more-serious arrhythmias. Illegal drugs, such as amphetamines and cocaine, may greatly affect the heart. Some may cause sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation.","Complications depend on the type of heart arrhythmia. Possible complications of heart arrhythmias include:
Blood clots, which can lead to stroke.
Heart failure.
Sudden cardiac death.
Blood-thinning medicines can lower the risk of stroke related to atrial fibrillation and other heart arrhythmias. If you have a heart arrhythmia, ask a healthcare professional if you need to take a blood thinner.
If an arrhythmia is causing heart failure symptoms, treatment to control the heart rate may help the heart work better.","Lifestyle changes used to manage heart disease may help prevent heart arrhythmias. Try these heart-healthy tips:
Don't smoke.
Eat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat.
Exercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week.
Maintain a healthy weight.
Reduce and manage stress.
Control high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.
Get good sleep. Adults should aim for 7 to 9 hours daily.
Limit or avoid caffeine and alcohol.","To diagnose a heart arrhythmia, a healthcare professional examines you and asks about your medical history and symptoms.
You may have tests to check your heart and to look for health conditions that can cause an irregular heartbeat.","Treatment for a heart arrhythmia depends on whether the heart is beating too fast or too slow. Some heart arrhythmias do not need treatment. Your healthcare team may suggest regular checkups to watch your condition.
Heart arrhythmia treatment is usually only needed if the irregular heartbeat causes significant symptoms or puts you at risk of more-serious heart problems. Treatment for heart arrhythmias may include medicines, special actions called vagal maneuvers, procedures or surgery.",,Medical appointments can be brief. There's often a lot to discuss. So it's a good idea to be prepared for your appointment. Here's some information to help you prepare for your appointment.,"Making lifestyle changes can help keep your heart as healthy as possible.
Examples of heart-healthy lifestyle changes are:
Eat heart-healthy foods.Eat a healthy diet that's low in salt and solid fats and rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.
Get regular exercise.Try to exercise for at least 30 minutes on most days.
Don't smoke.If you smoke and can't quit on your own, talk to a healthcare professional about strategies or programs to help.
Maintain a healthy weight.Being overweight increases the risk of heart disease. Talk with your care team to set realistic goals for body mass index (BMI) and weight.
Control blood pressure and cholesterol.High blood pressure and high cholesterol increase the risk of heart disease. Make lifestyle changes and take medicines as directed to manage high blood pressure or high cholesterol.
Limit alcohol.If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women of all ages and men older than age 65, and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger.
Practice good sleep habits.Poor sleep may increase the risk of heart disease and other chronic conditions. Adults should aim to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep daily. Go to bed and wake at the same time every day, including on weekends. If you have trouble sleeping, talk to a healthcare professional about strategies that might help.
Manage stress.Managing stress is an important step in keeping the heart healthy. Getting more exercise, practicing mindfulness and connecting with others in support groups are some ways to reduce and manage stress."
Giant cell arteritis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/giant-cell-arteritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20372758,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/giant-cell-arteritis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20372764,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/giant-cell-arteritis/doctors-departments/ddc-20372765,"Giant cell arteritis is an inflammation of the lining of your arteries. Most often, it affects the arteries in your head, especially those in your temples. For this reason, giant cell arteritis is sometimes called temporal arteritis.
Giant cell arteritis frequently causes headaches, scalp tenderness, jaw pain and vision problems. Untreated, it can lead to blindness.
Prompt treatment with corticosteroid medications usually relieves symptoms of giant cell arteritis and might prevent loss of vision. You'll likely begin to feel better within days of starting treatment. But even with treatment, relapses are common.
You'll need to visit your doctor regularly for checkups and treatment of any side effects from taking corticosteroids.","The most common symptoms of giant cell arteritis are head pain and tenderness — often severe — that usually affects both temples. Head pain can progressively worsen, come and go, or subside temporarily.
Generally, signs and symptoms of giant cell arteritis include:
Persistent, severe head pain, usually in your temple area
Scalp tenderness
Jaw pain when you chew or open your mouth wide
Fever
Fatigue
Unintended weight loss
Vision loss or double vision, particularly in people who also have jaw pain
Sudden, permanent loss of vision in one eye
Pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders or hips are common symptoms of a related disorder, polymyalgia rheumatica. About 50 percent of people with giant cell arteritis also have polymyalgia rheumatica.","If you develop a new, persistent headache or any of the signs and symptoms listed above, see your doctor without delay. If you're diagnosed with giant cell arteritis, starting treatment as soon as possible can usually help prevent vision loss.","With giant cell arteritis, the lining of arteries becomes inflamed, causing them to swell. This swelling narrows your blood vessels, reducing the amount of blood — and, therefore, oxygen and vital nutrients — that reaches your body's tissues.
Almost any large or medium-sized artery can be affected, but swelling most often occurs in the arteries in the temples. These are just in front of your ears and continue up into your scalp.
What causes these arteries to become inflamed isn't known, but it's thought to involve abnormal attacks on artery walls by the immune system. Certain genes and environmental factors might increase your susceptibility to the condition.","Several factors can increase your risk of developing giant cell arteritis, including:
Age.Giant cell arteritis affects adults only, and rarely those under 50. Most people with this condition develop signs and symptoms between the ages of 70 and 80.
Sex.Women are about two times more likely to develop the condition than men are.
Race and geographic region.Giant cell arteritis is most common among white people in Northern European populations or of Scandinavian descent.
Polymyalgia rheumatica.Having polymyalgia rheumatica puts you at increased risk of developing giant cell arteritis.
Family history.Sometimes the condition runs in families.","Giant cell arteritis can cause serious complications, including:
Blindness.Diminished blood flow to your eyes can cause sudden, painless vision loss in one or, rarely, both eyes. Loss of vision is usually permanent.
Aortic aneurysm.An aneurysm is a bulge that forms in a weakened blood vessel, usually in the large artery that runs down the center of your chest and abdomen (aorta). An aortic aneurysm might burst, causing life-threatening internal bleeding.Because this complication can occur even years after the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis, your doctor might monitor your aorta with annual chest X-rays or other imaging tests, such as ultrasound andCT.
Stroke.This is an uncommon complication of giant cell arteritis.",,"Giant cell arteritis can be difficult to diagnose because its early symptoms resemble those of other common conditions. For this reason, your doctor will try to rule out other possible causes of your problem.
In addition to asking about your symptoms and medical history, your doctor is likely to perform a thorough physical exam, paying particular attention to your temporal arteries. Often, one or both of these arteries are tender, with a reduced pulse and a hard, cordlike feel and appearance.
Your doctor might also recommend certain tests.","The main treatment for giant cell arteritis consists of high doses of a corticosteroid drug such as prednisone. Because immediate treatment is necessary to prevent vision loss, your doctor is likely to start medication even before confirming the diagnosis with a biopsy.
You'll likely begin to feel better within a few days of beginning treatment. If you have visual loss before starting treatment with corticosteroids, it's unlikely that your vision will improve. However, your unaffected eye might be able to compensate for some of the visual changes.
You may need to continue taking medication for one to two years or longer. After the first month, your doctor might gradually begin to lower the dosage until you reach the lowest dose of corticosteroids needed to control inflammation.
Some symptoms, particularly headaches, may return during this tapering period. This is the point at which many people also develop symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica. Such flares can usually be treated with slight increases in the corticosteroid dose. Your doctor might also suggest an immune-suppressing drug called methotrexate (Trexall).
Corticosteroids can lead to serious side effects, such as osteoporosis, high blood pressure and muscle weakness. To counter potential side effects, your doctor is likely to monitor your bone density and might prescribe calcium and vitamin D supplements or other medications to help prevent bone loss.
The Food and Drug Administration recently approved tocilizumab (Actemra) to treat giant cell arteritis. It's given as an injection under your skin. Side effects include making you more prone to infections. More research is needed.","Learning everything you can about giant cell arteritis and its treatment can help you feel more in control of your condition. Your health care team can answer your questions, and online support groups might also be of help. Know the possible side effects of the medications you take, and report any changes in your health to your doctor.","You might start by seeing your primary care doctor. He or she may refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) if you're having visual symptoms, a brain and nervous system specialist (neurologist) if you're having headaches, or a specialist in diseases of the joints, bones and muscles (rheumatologist).
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.","When giant cell arteritis is diagnosed and treated early, the prognosis is usually excellent. Your symptoms will likely improve quickly after beginning corticosteroid treatment, and your vision isn't likely to be affected.
The following suggestions might help you manage your condition and cope with side effects of your medication:
Eat a healthy diet.Eating well can help prevent potential problems, such as thinning bones, high blood pressure and diabetes. Emphasize fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats and fish, while limiting salt, sugar and alcohol.Be sure to get enough calcium and vitamin D. Experts recommend 1,200 milligrams (mg) of calcium and 800 international units (IU) of vitamin D a day for women over 50 and men over 70. Check with your doctor to see what dose is right for you.
Exercise regularly.Regular aerobic exercise, such as walking, can help prevent bone loss, high blood pressure and diabetes. It also benefits your heart and lungs. In addition, many people find that exercise improves their mood and overall sense of well-being.If you're not used to exercising, start out slowly and build up gradually. Your doctor can help you plan an exercise program.
Get checkups.See your doctor regularly to check for side effects of treatment and development of complications.
Ask about aspirin.Ask your doctor about taking between 75 and 150 mg of aspirin daily. Taken daily, low-dose aspirin might reduce the risk of blindness and stroke."
Takayasu's arteritis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/takayasus-arteritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351335,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/takayasus-arteritis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351340,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/takayasus-arteritis/doctors-departments/ddc-20351342,"Takayasu's arteritis (tah-kah-YAH-sooz ahr-tuh-RIE-tis) is a rare type of vasculitis, a group of disorders that causes blood vessel inflammation. In Takayasu's arteritis, the inflammation damages the large artery that carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body (aorta) and its main branches.

The disease can lead to narrowed or blocked arteries, or to weakened artery walls that may bulge (aneurysm) and tear. It can also lead to arm or chest pain, high blood pressure, and eventually heart failure or stroke.

If you don't have symptoms, you may not need treatment. But most people with the disease need medications to control inflammation in the arteries and to prevent complications. Even with treatment, relapses are common, and your symptoms may come and go.",The signs and symptoms of Takayasu's arteritis often occur in two stages.,"Seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest or arm pain, or signs of a stroke, such as face drooping, arm weakness or having difficulty speaking.

Make an appointment with your doctor if you have other signs or symptoms that worry you. Early detection of Takayasu's arteritis is key to getting effective treatment.

If you've already been diagnosed with Takayasu's arteritis, keep in mind that your symptoms may come and go even with effective treatment. Pay attention to symptoms similar to those that occurred originally or to any new ones, and be sure to tell your doctor promptly about changes.","With Takayasu's arteritis, the aorta and other major arteries, including those leading to your head and kidneys, can become inflamed. Over time the inflammation causes changes in these arteries, including thickening, narrowing and scarring.

No one knows exactly what causes the initial inflammation in Takayasu's arteritis. The condition is likely an autoimmune disease in which your immune system attacks your own arteries by mistake. The disease may be triggered by a virus or other infection.","Takayasu's arteritis primarily affects girls and women younger than 40. The disorder occurs worldwide, but it's most common in Asia. Sometimes the condition runs in families. Researchers have identified certain genes associated with Takayasu's arteritis.","With Takayasu's arteritis, cycles of inflammation and healing in the arteries might lead to one or more of the following complications:",,"Your doctor will ask you about your signs and symptoms, conduct a physical exam, and take your medical history. He or she may also have you undergo some of the following tests and procedures to help rule out other conditions that resemble Takayasu's arteritis and to confirm the diagnosis. Some of these tests may also be used to check on your progress during treatment.

X-rays of your blood vessels (angiography).During an angiogram, a long, flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into a large artery or vein. A special contrast dye is then injected into the catheter, and X-rays are taken as the dye fills your arteries or veins.

The resulting images allow your doctor to see if blood is flowing normally or if it's being slowed or interrupted due to narrowing (stenosis) of a blood vessel. A person with Takayasu's arteritis generally has several areas of stenosis.","Treatment of Takayasu's arteritis focuses on controlling inflammation with medications and preventing further damage to your blood vessels.

Takayasu's arteritis can be difficult to treat because the disease may remain active even if your symptoms improve. It's also possible that irreversible damage has already occurred by the time you're diagnosed.

On the other hand, if you don't have signs and symptoms or serious complications, you may not need treatment or you may be able to taper and stop treatment if your doctor recommends it.","One of the greatest challenges of living with Takayasu's arteritis may be coping with side effects of your medication. The following suggestions may help:

Eat a healthy diet.Eating well can help prevent potential problems that can result from your condition and medications, such as high blood pressure, thinning bones and diabetes. Emphasize fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats and fish, while limiting salt, sugar and alcohol.

If you're taking a corticosteroid drug, ask your doctor if you need to take a vitamin D or calcium supplement.","If your primary care doctor suspects that you have Takayasu's arteritis, he or she may refer you to one or more specialists with experience in helping people with this condition. Takayasu's arteritis is a rare disorder that can be difficult to diagnose and treat.

You may want to talk with your doctor about a referral to a medical center that specializes in treating vasculitis.

Because appointments can be brief and there's often a lot of information to discuss, it's a good idea to be prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.",
Thumb arthritis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thumb-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20378339,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thumb-arthritis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20378344,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thumb-arthritis/doctors-departments/ddc-20378345,"Thumb arthritis is common with aging and occurs when cartilage wears away from the ends of the bones that form the joint at the base of your thumb — also known as the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint.
Thumb arthritis can cause severe pain, swelling, and decreased strength and range of motion, making it difficult to do simple tasks, such as turning doorknobs and opening jars. Treatment generally involves a combination of medication and splints. Severe thumb arthritis might require surgery.","Pain is the first and most common symptom of thumb arthritis. Pain can occur at the base of your thumb when you grip, grasp or pinch an object, or use your thumb to apply force.
Other signs and symptoms might include:
Swelling, stiffness and tenderness at the base of your thumb
Decreased strength when pinching or grasping objects
Decreased range of motion
Enlarged or bony appearance of the joint at the base of your thumb","See your doctor if you have persistent swelling, stiffness or pain at the base of your thumb.","Thumb arthritis commonly occurs with aging. Previous trauma or injury to the thumb joint also can cause thumb arthritis.
In a normal thumb joint, cartilage covers the ends of the bones — acting as a cushion and allowing the bones to glide smoothly against each other. With thumb arthritis, the cartilage that covers the ends of the bones deteriorates, and its smooth surface roughens. The bones then rub against each other, resulting in friction and joint damage.
The damage to the joint might result in growth of new bone along the sides of the existing bone (bone spurs), which can produce noticeable lumps on your thumb joint.","Factors that can increase your risk of thumb arthritis include:
Female sex.
Age above 40 years.
Obesity.
Certain hereditary conditions, such as joint ligament laxity and malformed joints.
Injuries to your thumb joint, such as fractures and sprains.
Diseases that change the normal structure and function of cartilage, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Although osteoarthritis is the most common cause of thumb arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis can also affect the CMC joint, usually to a lesser extent than other joints of the hand.
Activities and jobs that put high stress on the thumb joint.",,,"During a physical exam, your doctor will ask about your symptoms and look for noticeable swelling or lumps on your joints.
Your doctor might hold your joint while moving your thumb, with pressure, against your wrist bone. If this movement produces a grinding sound, or causes pain or a gritty feeling, the cartilage has likely worn down, and the bones are rubbing against each other.
Imaging techniques, usually X-rays, can reveal signs of thumb arthritis, including:
Bone spurs
Worn-down cartilage
Loss of joint space","In the early stages of thumb arthritis, treatment usually involves a combination of non-surgical therapies. If your thumb arthritis is severe, surgery might be necessary.",,You might be referred to a doctor who specializes in disorders of the joints (rheumatologist).,"To ease pain and improve joint mobility, try to:
Modify hand tools.Consider purchasing adaptive equipment — such as jar openers, key turners and large zipper pulls — designed for people with limited hand strength. Replace traditional door handles, which you must grasp with your thumb, with levers.
Apply cold.Icing the joint for five to 15 minutes several times a day can help relieve swelling and pain.
Apply heat.For some, heat may be more effective than cold in relieving pain."

It happens when the protective cartilage that cushions the ends of the bones wears down over time.

Although osteoarthritis can damage any joint, the condition most commonly affects joints in the hands, knees, hips and spine.

Osteoarthritis symptoms can usually be managed, although the damage to joints can't be reversed. Staying active, maintaining a healthy weight and receiving certain treatments might slow progression of the disease and help improve pain and joint function.",Osteoarthritis symptoms often develop slowly and worsen over time. Symptoms of osteoarthritis include:,"If joint pain or stiffness doesn't go away, make an appointment with your healthcare professional.","Osteoarthritis happens when the cartilage that cushions the ends of bones in the joints gradually wears away. Cartilage is a firm, slippery tissue that allows nearly frictionless joint motion.

Eventually, if the cartilage wears down completely, bone will rub on bone.

Osteoarthritis doesn't only affect the cartilage. It also affects the entire joint. It causes changes in the bone and weakens the strong bands of tissue that hold the joint together and attach muscle to bone. It also may cause swelling of the joint lining.",Factors that can increase your risk of osteoarthritis include:,"Osteoarthritis is a disease that worsens over time, often resulting in chronic pain. Joint pain and stiffness can become severe enough to make daily tasks difficult.

Gout,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gout/symptoms-causes/syc-20372897,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gout/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20372903,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gout/doctors-departments/ddc-20372904,"Gout is a common and complex form of arthritis that can affect anyone. It's characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness and tenderness in one or more joints, most often in the big toe.
An attack of gout can occur suddenly, often waking you up in the middle of the night with the sensation that your big toe is on fire. The affected joint is hot, swollen and so tender that even the weight of the bedsheet on it may seem intolerable.
Gout symptoms may come and go, but there are ways to manage symptoms and prevent flares.","The signs and symptoms of gout almost always occur suddenly, and often at night. They include:
Intense joint pain.Gout usually affects the big toe, but it can occur in any joint. Other commonly affected joints include the ankles, knees, elbows, wrists and fingers. The pain is likely to be most severe within the first four to 12 hours after it begins.
Lingering discomfort.After the most severe pain subsides, some joint discomfort may last from a few days to a few weeks. Later attacks are likely to last longer and affect more joints.
Inflammation and redness.The affected joint or joints become swollen, tender, warm and red.
Limited range of motion.As gout progresses, you may not be able to move your joints normally.","If you experience sudden, intense pain in a joint, call your doctor. Gout that goes untreated can lead to worsening pain and joint damage. Seek medical care immediately if you have a fever and a joint is hot and inflamed, which can be a sign of infection.","Gout occurs when urate crystals accumulate in your joint, causing the inflammation and intense pain of a gout attack. Urate crystals can form when you have high levels of uric acid in your blood. Your body produces uric acid when it breaks down purines — substances that are found naturally in your body.
Purines are also found in certain foods, including red meat and organ meats, such as liver. Purine-rich seafood includes anchovies, sardines, mussels, scallops, trout and tuna. Alcoholic beverages, especially beer, and drinks sweetened with fruit sugar (fructose) promote higher levels of uric acid.
Normally, uric acid dissolves in your blood and passes through your kidneys into your urine. But sometimes either your body produces too much uric acid or your kidneys excrete too little uric acid. When this happens, uric acid can build up, forming sharp, needlelike urate crystals in a joint or surrounding tissue that cause pain, inflammation and swelling.","You're more likely to develop gout if you have high levels of uric acid in your body. Factors that increase the uric acid level in your body include:
Diet.Eating a diet rich in red meat and shellfish and drinking beverages sweetened with fruit sugar (fructose) increase levels of uric acid, which increase your risk of gout. Alcohol consumption, especially of beer, also increases the risk of gout.
Weight.If you're overweight, your body produces more uric acid and your kidneys have a more difficult time eliminating uric acid.
Medical conditions.Certain diseases and conditions increase your risk of gout. These include untreated high blood pressure and chronic conditions such as diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and heart and kidney diseases.
Certain medications.Low-dose aspirin and some medications used to control hypertension — including thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers — also can increase uric acid levels. So can the use of anti-rejection drugs prescribed for people who have undergone an organ transplant.
Family history of gout.If other members of your family have had gout, you're more likely to develop the disease.
Age and sex.Gout occurs more often in men, primarily because women tend to have lower uric acid levels. After menopause, however, women's uric acid levels approach those of men. Men are also more likely to develop gout earlier — usually between the ages of 30 and 50 — whereas women generally develop signs and symptoms after menopause.
Recent surgery or trauma.Experiencing recent surgery or trauma can sometimes trigger a gout attack. In some people, receiving a vaccination can trigger a gout flare.","People with gout can develop more-severe conditions, such as:
Recurrent gout.Some people may never experience gout signs and symptoms again. Others may experience gout several times each year. Medications may help prevent gout attacks in people with recurrent gout. If left untreated, gout can cause erosion and destruction of a joint.
Advanced gout.Untreated gout may cause deposits of urate crystals to form under the skin in nodules called tophi (TOE-fie). Tophi can develop in several areas, such as your fingers, hands, feet, elbows or Achilles tendons along the backs of your ankles. Tophi usually aren't painful, but they can become swollen and tender during gout attacks.
Kidney stones.Urate crystals may collect in the urinary tracts of people with gout, causing kidney stones. Medications can help reduce the risk of kidney stones.",,"Doctors usually diagnose gout based on your symptoms and the appearance of the affected joint. Tests to help diagnose gout may include:
Joint fluid test.Your doctor may use a needle to draw fluid from your affected joint. Urate crystals may be visible when the fluid is examined under a microscope.
Blood test.Your doctor may recommend a blood test to measure the levels of uric acid in your blood. Blood test results can be misleading, though. Some people have high uric acid levels, but never experience gout. And some people have signs and symptoms of gout, but don't have unusual levels of uric acid in their blood.
X-ray imaging.Joint X-rays can be helpful to rule out other causes of joint inflammation.
Ultrasound.This test uses sound waves to detect urate crystals in joints or in tophi.
Dual-energy computerized tomography (DECT).This test combines X-ray images taken from many different angles to visualize urate crystals in joints.","Gout medications are available in two types and focus on two different problems. The first type helps reduce the inflammation and pain associated with gout attacks. The second type works to prevent gout complications by lowering the amount of uric acid in your blood.
Which type of medication is right for you depends on the frequency and severity of your symptoms, along with any other health problems you may have.",,"Make an appointment with your doctor if you have symptoms that are common to gout. After an initial examination, your doctor may refer you to a specialist in the diagnosis and treatment of arthritis and other inflammatory joint conditions (rheumatologist).
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment, and what to expect from your doctor.","Medications are often the most effective way to treat gout attacks and prevent recurrent symptom flares. However, lifestyle choices also are important, and you may want to:
Choose healthier beverages.Limit alcoholic beverages and drinks sweetened with fruit sugar (fructose). Instead, drink plenty of nonalcoholic beverages, especially water.
Avoid foods high in purines.Red meat and organ meats, such as liver, are especially high in purines. Purine-rich seafood includes anchovies, sardines, mussels, scallops, trout and tuna. Low-fat dairy products may be a better source of protein for people prone to gout.
Exercise regularly and lose weight.Keeping your body at a healthy weight reduces your risk of gout. Choose low-impact activities such as walking, bicycling and swimming — which are easier on your joints."
Septic arthritis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bone-and-joint-infections/symptoms-causes/syc-20350755,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bone-and-joint-infections/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350760,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bone-and-joint-infections/doctors-departments/ddc-20350761,"Septic arthritis is a painful infection in a joint that can come from germs that travel through your bloodstream from another part of your body. Septic arthritis can also occur when a penetrating injury, such as an animal bite or trauma, delivers germs directly into the joint.

Infants and older adults are most likely to develop septic arthritis. People who have artificial joints are also at risk of septic arthritis. Knees are most commonly affected, but septic arthritis also can affect hips, shoulders and other joints. The infection can quickly and severely damage the cartilage and bone within the joint, so prompt treatment is crucial.

Treatment involves draining the joint with a needle or during surgery. Antibiotics also are usually needed.","Septic arthritis typically causes extreme discomfort and difficulty using the affected joint. The joint could be swollen, red and warm, and you might have a fever.

If septic arthritis occurs in an artificial joint (prosthetic joint infection), signs and symptoms such as minor pain and swelling may develop months or years after knee replacement or hip replacement surgery. Also, a loosening of the joint may occur, which causes pain while moving the joint or while putting weight on the joint. Typically, the pain goes away when at rest. In extreme cases, the joint may become dislocated.","See your doctor if you have severe pain in a joint that comes on suddenly. Prompt treatment can help minimize joint damage.

If you have an artificial joint, see your doctor if you experience pain while using the joint.","Septic arthritis can be caused by bacterial, viral or fungal infections. Bacterial infection with Staphylococcus aureus (staph) is the most common cause. Staph commonly lives on even healthy skin.

Septic arthritis can develop when an infection, such as a skin infection or urinary tract infection, spreads through your bloodstream to a joint. Less commonly, a puncture wound, drug injection, or surgery in or near a joint — including joint replacement surgery — can give the germs entry into the joint space.

The lining of your joints has little ability to protect itself from infection. Your body's reaction to the infection — including inflammation that can increase pressure and reduce blood flow within the joint — contributes to the damage.","Risk factors for septic arthritis include:

Having a combination of risk factors puts you at greater risk than having just one risk factor does.","If treatment is delayed, septic arthritis can lead to joint degeneration and permanent damage. If septic arthritis affects an artificial joint, complications may include joint loosening or dislocation.",,"The following tests typically help diagnose septic arthritis:

Imaging tests.X-rays and other imaging tests of the affected joint can assess damage to the joint or loosening of an artificial joint.

A specialized scan that involves swallowing or injecting a small amount of a radioactive chemical may be used if your doctor suspects you have a prosthetic joint infection and it's been more than a year since you've had surgery.",Doctors rely on joint drainage and antibiotic drugs to treat septic arthritis.,,"If you have painful and inflamed joints, you're likely to start by seeing your family doctor. He or she may refer you to an orthopedic surgeon, infectious disease specialist or joint specialist (rheumatologist).

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20374082,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374088,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/doctors-departments/ddc-20374089,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, formerly known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, is the most common type of arthritis in children under the age of 16.
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis can cause persistent joint pain, swelling and stiffness. Some children may experience symptoms for only a few months, while others have symptoms for many years.
Some types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis can cause serious complications, such as growth problems, joint damage and eye inflammation. Treatment focuses on controlling pain and inflammation, improving function, and preventing damage.","The most common signs and symptoms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are:
Pain.While your child might not complain of joint pain, you may notice that he or she limps — especially first thing in the morning or after a nap.
Swelling.Joint swelling is common but is often first noticed in larger joints such as the knee.
Stiffness.You might notice that your child appears clumsier than usual, particularly in the morning or after naps.
Fever, swollen lymph nodes and rash.In some cases, high fever, swollen lymph nodes or a rash on the trunk may occur — which is usually worse in the evenings.
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis can affect one joint or many. There are several different subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, but the main ones are systemic, oligoarticular and polyarticular. Which type your child has depends on symptoms, the number of joints affected, and if a fever and rashes are prominent features.
Like other forms of arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis is characterized by times when symptoms flare up and times when symptoms may be minimal.","Take your child to the doctor if he or she has joint pain, swelling or stiffness for more than a week — especially if he or she also has a fever.","Juvenile idiopathic arthritis occurs when the body's immune system attacks its own cells and tissues. It's not known why this happens, but both heredity and environment seem to play a role.",Some forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are more common in girls.,"Several serious complications can result from juvenile idiopathic arthritis. But keeping a careful watch on your child's condition and seeking appropriate medical attention can greatly reduce the risk of these complications:
Eye problems.Some forms can cause eye inflammation. If this condition is left untreated, it may result in cataracts, glaucoma and even blindness.Eye inflammation frequently occurs without symptoms, so it's important for children with this condition to be examined regularly by an ophthalmologist.
Growth problems.Juvenile idiopathic arthritis can interfere with your child's growth and bone development. Some medications used for treatment, mainly corticosteroids, also can inhibit growth.",,"Diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis can be difficult because joint pain can be caused by many different types of problems. No single test can confirm a diagnosis, but tests can help rule out some other conditions that produce similar signs and symptoms.","Treatment for juvenile idiopathic arthritis focuses on helping your child maintain a normal level of physical and social activity. To accomplish this, doctors may use a combination of strategies to relieve pain and swelling, maintain full movement and strength, and prevent complications.","Family members can play critical roles in helping children cope with their condition. As a parent, you may want to try the following:
Treat your child like other children in your family as much as possible.
Allow your child to express anger about having juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Explain that the disease isn't caused by anything he or she did.
Encourage your child to participate in physical activities, keeping in mind the recommendations of your child's doctor and physical therapist.
Discuss your child's condition and the issues surrounding it with teachers and administrators at his or her school.","If your pediatrician or family doctor suspects that your child has juvenile idiopathic arthritis, he or she may refer you to a doctor who specializes in arthritis (rheumatologist) to confirm the diagnosis and explore treatment.","Caregivers can help children learn self-care techniques that help limit the effects of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Techniques include:
Getting regular exercise.Exercise is important because it promotes both muscle strength and joint flexibility. Swimming is an excellent choice because it places minimal stress on joints.
Applying cold or heat.Stiffness affects many children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, particularly in the morning. Some children respond well to cold packs, particularly after activity. However, most children prefer warmth, such as a hot pack or a hot bath or shower, especially in the morning.
Eating well.Some children with arthritis have poor appetites. Others may gain excess weight due to medications or physical inactivity. A healthy diet can help maintain an appropriate body weight.Adequate calcium in the diet is important because children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis are at risk of developing weak bones due to the disease, the use of corticosteroids, and decreased physical activity and weight bearing."

It happens when the protective cartilage that cushions the ends of the bones wears down over time.

Although osteoarthritis can damage any joint, the condition most commonly affects joints in the hands, knees, hips and spine.

Osteoarthritis symptoms can usually be managed, although the damage to joints can't be reversed. Staying active, maintaining a healthy weight and receiving certain treatments might slow progression of the disease and help improve pain and joint function.",Osteoarthritis symptoms often develop slowly and worsen over time. Symptoms of osteoarthritis include:,"If joint pain or stiffness doesn't go away, make an appointment with your healthcare professional.","Osteoarthritis happens when the cartilage that cushions the ends of bones in the joints gradually wears away. Cartilage is a firm, slippery tissue that allows nearly frictionless joint motion.

Eventually, if the cartilage wears down completely, bone will rub on bone.

Osteoarthritis doesn't only affect the cartilage. It also affects the entire joint. It causes changes in the bone and weakens the strong bands of tissue that hold the joint together and attach muscle to bone. It also may cause swelling of the joint lining.",Factors that can increase your risk of osteoarthritis include:,"Osteoarthritis is a disease that worsens over time, often resulting in chronic pain. Joint pain and stiffness can become severe enough to make daily tasks difficult.

Depression and sleep disturbances can result from the pain, stiffness and mobility issues of osteoarthritis.",,"During the physical exam, your healthcare professional checks your affected joint for tenderness, swelling and flexibility.","Osteoarthritis can't be reversed, but treatments can reduce pain and help you move better.",Your ability to cope despite pain and disability caused by osteoarthritis often determines how much of an impact osteoarthritis has on your life. Talk to your healthcare team if you're feeling frustrated. Your care team may have ideas to help you cope or be able to refer you to someone who can help.,"You might start by seeing your primary healthcare professional, who might refer you to a doctor who specializes in joint conditions, called a rheumatologist, or to an orthopedic surgeon.",
Psoriatic arthritis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/psoriatic-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354076,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/psoriatic-arthritis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354081,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/psoriatic-arthritis/doctors-departments/ddc-20354084,"Psoriatic arthritis is a form of arthritis that affects some people who have psoriasis — a disease that causes red patches of skin topped with silvery scales. Most people develop psoriasis years before being diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis. But for some, the joint problems begin before skin patches appear or at the same time.

Joint pain, stiffness and swelling are the main signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis. They can affect any part of the body, including your fingertips and spine, and can range from relatively mild to severe. In both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, disease flares can alternate with periods of remission.

There's no cure for psoriatic arthritis. Treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms and preventing joint damage. Without treatment, psoriatic arthritis can be disabling.","Both psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis are chronic diseases that worsen over time. However, you might have periods when your symptoms improve or go away temporarily.

Psoriatic arthritis can affect joints on one or both sides of your body. The signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis often resemble those of rheumatoid arthritis. Both diseases cause joints to become painful, swollen and warm to the touch.

However, psoriatic arthritis is more likely to also cause:","If you have psoriasis, tell your doctor if you develop joint pain. Psoriatic arthritis can severely damage your joints if left untreated.","Psoriatic arthritis occurs when your body's immune system attacks healthy cells and tissue. The immune response causes inflammation in your joints as well as overproduction of skin cells.

It seems likely that both genetic and environmental factors play a role in this immune system response. Many people with psoriatic arthritis have a family history of either psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. Researchers have discovered certain genetic markers that appear to be associated with psoriatic arthritis.

Physical trauma or something in the environment — such as a viral or bacterial infection — might trigger psoriatic arthritis in people with an inherited tendency.","Several factors can increase your risk of psoriatic arthritis, including:","A small percentage of people with psoriatic arthritis develop arthritis mutilans — a severe, painful and disabling form of psoriatic arthritis. Over time, arthritis mutilans destroys the small bones in the hands, especially the fingers, leading to permanent deformity and disability.

Psoriatic arthritis also puts some people at higher risk of developing hypertension, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and cardiovascular disease",,"During the exam, your doctor might:

No single test can confirm a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis. But some types of tests can rule out other causes of joint pain, such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout.","No cure exists for psoriatic arthritis. Treatment focuses on controlling inflammation in your affected joints to prevent joint pain and disability and controlling skin involvement. One of the most common treatments are prescription medications called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

Treatment will depend on how severe your disease is and what joints are affected. You might have to try different treatments before you find one that brings you relief.","The support of friends and family can make a tremendous difference when you're facing the challenges of psoriatic arthritis. For some people, support groups can offer the same benefits. A counselor or therapist can help you devise coping strategies to reduce your stress levels.",You're likely to first discuss your signs and symptoms with your family doctor.

This condition usually targets the knees, ankles and feet. Inflammation also can affect the eyes, skin and the tube that carries urine out of the body (urethra). Previously, reactive arthritis was sometimes called Reiter's syndrome.

Reactive arthritis isn't common. For most people, signs and symptoms come and go, eventually disappearing within 12 months.",The signs and symptoms of reactive arthritis generally start 1 to 4 weeks after exposure to a triggering infection. They might include:,"If you develop joint pain within a month of having diarrhea or a genital infection, contact your health care provider.","Reactive arthritis develops in reaction to an infection in your body, often in your intestines, genitals or urinary tract. You might not be aware of the triggering infection if it causes mild symptoms or none at all.

Numerous bacteria can cause reactive arthritis. Some are transmitted sexually, and others are foodborne. The most common ones include:

Reactive arthritis isn't contagious. However, the bacteria that cause it can be transmitted sexually or in contaminated food. Only a few of the people who are exposed to these bacteria develop reactive arthritis.",Certain factors increase your risk of reactive arthritis:,,"Genetic factors appear to play a role in whether you're likely to develop reactive arthritis. Though you can't change your genetic makeup, you can reduce your exposure to the bacteria that may lead to reactive arthritis.

Store your food at proper temperatures and cook it properly. Doing these things help you avoid the many foodborne bacteria that can cause reactive arthritis, including salmonella, shigella, yersinia and campylobacter. Some sexually transmitted infections can trigger reactive arthritis. Use condoms to help lower your risk.","During the physical exam, your doctor is likely to check your joints for swelling, warmth and tenderness, and test range of motion in your spine and affected joints. Your doctor might also check your eyes for inflammation and your skin for rashes.",The goal of treatment is to manage your symptoms and treat an infection that could still be present.,,"You'll likely start by seeing your primary care provider, who might refer you to a doctor who specializes in arthritis (rheumatologist) for further evaluation.",
Rheumatoid arthritis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353648,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353653,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/doctors-departments/ddc-20353657,"Rheumatoid arthritis is an ongoing, called chronic, condition that causes pain, swelling and irritation, called inflammation, in the joints. But it also can damage other parts of the body. These may include the skin, eyes, lungs, heart and blood vessels.
Rheumatoid arthritis happens when the immune system attacks its own body's tissues by mistake. This is called an autoimmune condition.
Rheumatoid arthritis differs from the more common osteoarthritis. Some people have both. Osteoarthritis causes damage to joints from overuse. Rheumatoid arthritis affects the lining of the joints and eats away at the bone under them. This causes a painful swelling that can cause joints to bend out of shape over time, called deformity.
The inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis also can damage other parts of the body. New medicines have improved treatment choices greatly. But rheumatoid arthritis still can cause long-term damage and increase the risk of heart disease.","Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include:
Painful, warm, swollen joints.
Joint stiffness that most often is worse in the mornings and after periods of rest. It can last for 45 minutes or longer.
Tiredness, fever and not wanting to eat.
Rheumatoid arthritis may affect just a few joints at first. Most often, these are the small joints of the hands and the feet.
As the disease gets worse, symptoms may spread to more joints. These most often include the wrists, elbows, hips, knees and ankles. Most of the time, symptoms affect the same joints on both sides of the body.
Many people who have rheumatoid arthritis also have symptoms that affect more than the joints. Areas that may be affected include:
Skin.
Eyes.
Lungs.
Heart.
Nerve tissue.
Blood.
Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms may vary in how bad they are. They may come and go. Periods when the condition becomes more active, called flares, follow periods of less or no swelling and pain. This is called remission.
Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to bend out of shape and shift out of place. The joints can be hard to use for daily activities at home or at work.",Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you have ongoing pain and swelling in your joints that is not getting better after several weeks.,"Experts don't know the cause of rheumatoid arthritis. But it's a condition in which the immune system attacks healthy joint tissue by mistake, called autoimmune.
The cause is likely a mix of genetic changes and factors from outside the body, called environmental. Hormones may play a role. An infection with certain viruses may start rheumatoid arthritis in people whose genes make them more likely to get it.","Factors that may increase your risk of rheumatoid arthritis include:
Your sex.People assigned female at birth are more likely than those assigned male at birth to get rheumatoid arthritis.
Age.Rheumatoid arthritis can happen at any age. But most often it begins in middle age. Children and young teens may get a related condition called juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
Family history.Having a family member with rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune conditions may raise the risk of the condition.
Smoking.Cigarette smoking over time raises the risk of getting rheumatoid arthritis. Smoking also seems to make the condition worse in people who keep smoking.
Gum infection.A serious gum infection, called periodontal disease, can damage the soft tissue around teeth and raise the risk of getting rheumatoid arthritis.
Excess weight.People who are overweight seem to be at a somewhat higher risk of getting rheumatoid arthritis.","Rheumatoid arthritis increases the risk of getting:
Osteoporosis.Rheumatoid arthritis itself, and some medicines used to treat it, can increase the risk of this condition. Osteoporosis weakens bones and makes them more likely to break.
Rheumatoid nodules.These firm bumps of tissue most often form around pressure points, such as the elbows. But these nodules can form anywhere in the body, including the heart and lungs.
Dry eyes and mouth.People who have rheumatoid arthritis are much more likely to get a condition that lowers the amount of moisture in the eyes and mouth. This is called secondary Sjogren's syndrome.
Infections.Rheumatoid arthritis and many of the medicines used to treat it can harm the immune system. This can lead to more infections. Vaccinations can help prevent infections such as the flu, pneumonia, shingles and COVID-19.
Carpal tunnel syndrome.If rheumatoid arthritis affects the wrists, the swelling can press on the nerve to the hand and fingers.
Heart problems.Rheumatoid arthritis can raise the risk of hardened and blocked arteries. It also can raise the risk of swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the sac around the heart.
Lung disease.People with rheumatoid arthritis have a higher risk of swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of lung tissues. This can cause scarring and lead to shortness of breath that gets worse over time.
Lymphoma.Rheumatoid arthritis raises the risk of a group of blood cancers that happen in the lymph system. This is called lymphoma. People with rheumatoid arthritis may have a higher risk of other cancers, as well.",,"Rheumatoid arthritis can be hard to diagnose in its early stages. That's because the early symptoms can be like those of other common conditions.
During the physical exam, your healthcare professional checks your joints for swelling, redness and warmth. Your healthcare professional also may check your reflexes and muscle strength.","There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis. Joint damage can happen quickly without treatment. But clinical studies show that easing of symptoms, called remission, is more likely with early treatment with medicines called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis also involves regular follow-up with your healthcare team. This is to watch for joint damage, to see whether treatment is working and to look for possible side effects of treatment.","Pain and not being able to move well because of rheumatoid arthritis can affect a person's work and family life. Depression and worry are common. You also might feel helpless and feel bad about yourself.
How much rheumatoid arthritis affects your daily life depends in part on how well you cope with the condition. Talk with your healthcare team about ways to cope. With time, you'll learn what works for you. In the meantime, try to:
Take control.With your healthcare team, make a plan to manage your arthritis. This will help you feel in charge of your condition.
Know your limits.Rest when you're tired. Rheumatoid arthritis can make you very tired. Rest or take a short nap when you need to.
Connect with others.Let people close to you know how you're feeling. They may be worried about you but might not feel it's OK to ask about your pain. Find someone you can talk to when your condition feels like it's too much for you to handle.It also might help to connect with others who have rheumatoid arthritis. You can do this through a local support group or online.
Take time for yourself.Find time to do what you like. Write in a journal, go for a walk or listen to music. These can help lower stress.","You might first see your main healthcare professional. Your healthcare professional may send you to a specialist in the treatment of arthritis and other inflammatory conditions, called a rheumatologist.","Self-care measures, when used with your rheumatoid arthritis medicines, can help you manage your symptoms:
Exercise regularly.Gentle exercise can help strengthen the muscles around your joints. And it can help you feel less tired. Check with your healthcare team before you start exercising. Walking is a good way to begin. Don't exercise tender, injured or inflamed joints.
Apply heat or cold.Heat can help ease your pain and relax tense, painful muscles. Cold may dull pain. Cold also numbs and can ease swelling.
Relax.Find ways to cope with pain by lowering your stress. Techniques such as guided imagery, deep breathing and muscle relaxation all can help control pain.
Don't smoke.Smoking can make rheumatoid arthritis worse. If you smoke, ask your healthcare team to help you quit."
Septic arthritis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bone-and-joint-infections/symptoms-causes/syc-20350755,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bone-and-joint-infections/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350760,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bone-and-joint-infections/doctors-departments/ddc-20350761,"Septic arthritis is a painful infection in a joint that can come from germs that travel through your bloodstream from another part of your body. Septic arthritis can also occur when a penetrating injury, such as an animal bite or trauma, delivers germs directly into the joint.

Infants and older adults are most likely to develop septic arthritis. People who have artificial joints are also at risk of septic arthritis. Knees are most commonly affected, but septic arthritis also can affect hips, shoulders and other joints. The infection can quickly and severely damage the cartilage and bone within the joint, so prompt treatment is crucial.

Treatment involves draining the joint with a needle or during surgery. Antibiotics also are usually needed.","Septic arthritis typically causes extreme discomfort and difficulty using the affected joint. The joint could be swollen, red and warm, and you might have a fever.

If septic arthritis occurs in an artificial joint (prosthetic joint infection), signs and symptoms such as minor pain and swelling may develop months or years after knee replacement or hip replacement surgery. Also, a loosening of the joint may occur, which causes pain while moving the joint or while putting weight on the joint. Typically, the pain goes away when at rest. In extreme cases, the joint may become dislocated.","See your doctor if you have severe pain in a joint that comes on suddenly. Prompt treatment can help minimize joint damage.

If you have an artificial joint, see your doctor if you experience pain while using the joint.","Septic arthritis can be caused by bacterial, viral or fungal infections. Bacterial infection with Staphylococcus aureus (staph) is the most common cause. Staph commonly lives on even healthy skin.

Septic arthritis can develop when an infection, such as a skin infection or urinary tract infection, spreads through your bloodstream to a joint. Less commonly, a puncture wound, drug injection, or surgery in or near a joint — including joint replacement surgery — can give the germs entry into the joint space.

The lining of your joints has little ability to protect itself from infection. Your body's reaction to the infection — including inflammation that can increase pressure and reduce blood flow within the joint — contributes to the damage.","Risk factors for septic arthritis include:

Having a combination of risk factors puts you at greater risk than having just one risk factor does.","If treatment is delayed, septic arthritis can lead to joint degeneration and permanent damage. If septic arthritis affects an artificial joint, complications may include joint loosening or dislocation.",,"The following tests typically help diagnose septic arthritis:

Imaging tests.X-rays and other imaging tests of the affected joint can assess damage to the joint or loosening of an artificial joint.

A specialized scan that involves swallowing or injecting a small amount of a radioactive chemical may be used if your doctor suspects you have a prosthetic joint infection and it's been more than a year since you've had surgery.",Doctors rely on joint drainage and antibiotic drugs to treat septic arthritis.,,"If you have painful and inflamed joints, you're likely to start by seeing your family doctor. He or she may refer you to an orthopedic surgeon, infectious disease specialist or joint specialist (rheumatologist).

Thumb arthritis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thumb-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20378339,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thumb-arthritis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20378344,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thumb-arthritis/doctors-departments/ddc-20378345,"Thumb arthritis is common with aging and occurs when cartilage wears away from the ends of the bones that form the joint at the base of your thumb — also known as the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint.
Thumb arthritis can cause severe pain, swelling, and decreased strength and range of motion, making it difficult to do simple tasks, such as turning doorknobs and opening jars. Treatment generally involves a combination of medication and splints. Severe thumb arthritis might require surgery.","Pain is the first and most common symptom of thumb arthritis. Pain can occur at the base of your thumb when you grip, grasp or pinch an object, or use your thumb to apply force.
Other signs and symptoms might include:
Swelling, stiffness and tenderness at the base of your thumb
Decreased strength when pinching or grasping objects
Decreased range of motion
Enlarged or bony appearance of the joint at the base of your thumb","See your doctor if you have persistent swelling, stiffness or pain at the base of your thumb.","Thumb arthritis commonly occurs with aging. Previous trauma or injury to the thumb joint also can cause thumb arthritis.
In a normal thumb joint, cartilage covers the ends of the bones — acting as a cushion and allowing the bones to glide smoothly against each other. With thumb arthritis, the cartilage that covers the ends of the bones deteriorates, and its smooth surface roughens. The bones then rub against each other, resulting in friction and joint damage.
The damage to the joint might result in growth of new bone along the sides of the existing bone (bone spurs), which can produce noticeable lumps on your thumb joint.","Factors that can increase your risk of thumb arthritis include:
Female sex.
Age above 40 years.
Obesity.
Certain hereditary conditions, such as joint ligament laxity and malformed joints.
Injuries to your thumb joint, such as fractures and sprains.
Diseases that change the normal structure and function of cartilage, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Although osteoarthritis is the most common cause of thumb arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis can also affect the CMC joint, usually to a lesser extent than other joints of the hand.
Activities and jobs that put high stress on the thumb joint.",,,"During a physical exam, your doctor will ask about your symptoms and look for noticeable swelling or lumps on your joints.
Your doctor might hold your joint while moving your thumb, with pressure, against your wrist bone. If this movement produces a grinding sound, or causes pain or a gritty feeling, the cartilage has likely worn down, and the bones are rubbing against each other.
Imaging techniques, usually X-rays, can reveal signs of thumb arthritis, including:
Bone spurs
Worn-down cartilage
Loss of joint space","In the early stages of thumb arthritis, treatment usually involves a combination of non-surgical therapies. If your thumb arthritis is severe, surgery might be necessary.",,You might be referred to a doctor who specializes in disorders of the joints (rheumatologist).,"To ease pain and improve joint mobility, try to:
Modify hand tools.Consider purchasing adaptive equipment — such as jar openers, key turners and large zipper pulls — designed for people with limited hand strength. Replace traditional door handles, which you must grasp with your thumb, with levers.
Apply cold.Icing the joint for five to 15 minutes several times a day can help relieve swelling and pain.
Apply heat.For some, heat may be more effective than cold in relieving pain."

That means it's a congenital heart defect. People with anASDhave a hole between the upper heart chambers. The hole increases the amount of blood going through the lungs.
Small atrial septal defects might be found by chance and never cause a concern. Others might close during infancy or early childhood.
A large, long-term atrial septal defect can damage the heart and lungs. Surgery may be needed to repair an atrial septal defect and to prevent complications.","A baby born with an atrial septal defect (ASD) may not have symptoms. Symptoms may begin in adulthood.
Atrial septal defect symptoms may include:
Shortness of breath, especially when exercising.
Tiredness, especially with activity.
Swelling of the legs, feet or belly area.
Irregular heartbeats, also called arrhythmias.
Skipped heartbeats or feelings of a quick, pounding or fluttering heartbeat, called palpitations.","Serious congenital heart defects are often diagnosed before or soon after a child is born.
Get immediate emergency help if a child has trouble breathing.
Call a healthcare professional if these symptoms occur:
Shortness of breath, especially during exercise or activity.
Easy tiring, especially after activity.
Swelling of the legs, feet or belly area.
Skipped heartbeats or feelings of a quick, pounding heartbeat.","The cause of atrial septal defect is not clear. The problem affects the structure of the heart. It happens as the baby's heart is forming during pregnancy.
The following may play a role in the cause of congenital heart defects such as atrial septal defect:
Changes in genes.
Some medical conditions.
Certain medicines.
Smoking.
Alcohol misuse.","Atrial septal defect (ASD) occurs as the baby's heart is forming during pregnancy. It is a congenital heart defect. Things that may increase a baby's risk of atrial septal defect or other heart problems present at birth include:
German measles, also called rubella, during the first few months of pregnancy.
Diabetes.
Lupus.
Alcohol or tobacco use during pregnancy.
Cocaine use during pregnancy.
Use of some medicines during pregnancy, including those to treat seizures and mood conditions.
Some types of congenital heart defects occur in families. This means they are inherited. Tell your care team if you or someone in your family had a heart problem present at birth. Screening by a genetic counselor can help show the risk of certain heart defects in future children.","A small atrial septal defect might never cause any concern. Small atrial septal defects often close during infancy.
Larger atrial septal defects can cause serious complications, including:
Right-sided heart failure.
Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias.
Stroke.
Early death.
High blood pressure in the lung arteries, called pulmonary hypertension.
Pulmonary hypertension can cause permanent lung damage. This complication, called Eisenmenger syndrome, most often occurs over many years. It sometimes happens in people with large atrial septal defects.
Treatment can prevent or help manage many of these complications.","Because the cause of atrial septal defect (ASD) is not clear, prevention may not be possible. But getting good prenatal care is important. If you were born with anASD, make an appointment for a health checkup before becoming pregnant.
During this visit:
Talk about current health conditions and medicines.It's important to closely control diabetes, lupus and other health conditions during pregnancy. Your healthcare professional may suggest changing doses of some medicines or stopping them before pregnancy.
Review your family medical history.If you have a family history of congenital heart defects or other genetic conditions, you might talk with a genetic counselor to find your risks.
Ask about getting tested to see if you've had German measles, also called rubella.Rubella in a pregnant person has been linked to some types of congenital heart defects in the baby. If you haven't already had German measles or the vaccine, get the recommended vaccinations.","Some atrial septal defects (ASDs) are found before or soon after a child is born. But smaller ones may not be found until later in life.
If anASDis present, a healthcare professional may hear a whooshing sound called a heart murmur when listening to the heart with a device called a stethoscope.","Treatment for atrial septal defect (ASD) depends on:
The size of the hole in the heart.
Whether there are other heart problems present at birth.
An atrial septal defect may close on its own during childhood. For small holes that don't close, regular health checkups may be the only care needed.
Some atrial septal defects that do not close need a procedure to close the hole. But closure of anASDisn't recommended in those who have severe pulmonary hypertension.",,"A doctor trained in heart problems present at birth usually provides care for people with an atrial septal defect. This type of healthcare professional is called a congenital cardiologist.
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.","Following a heart-healthy lifestyle is important. This includes eating healthy, not smoking, managing weight and getting enough sleep. If you or your child has an atrial septal defect, talk to your healthcare team about the following:
Exercise.Exercise is usually OK for people with an atrial septal defect. But ifASDrepair is needed, you might have to stop certain activities until the hole in the heart is fixed. Ask a healthcare professional what type and amount of exercise is safest.
Extreme altitude changes.Extreme changes in location above or below sea level may cause complications in people with an unrepaired atrial septal defect. For example, there's less oxygen at higher altitudes. The lower amount of oxygen changes blood flow through the lung arteries. This can cause shortness of breath and strain the heart.
Dental work.If you or your child recently had anASDfixed and need dental work, talk to a healthcare professional. You or your child may need to take antibiotics for about six months after repair surgery to prevent infection."
Autism spectrum disorder,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20352928,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352934,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder/doctors-departments/ddc-20352937,"Autism spectrum disorder is a condition related to brain development that affects how people see others and socialize with them. This causes problems in communication and getting along with others socially. The condition also includes limited and repeated patterns of behavior. The term ""spectrum"" in autism spectrum disorder refers to the wide range of symptoms and the severity of these symptoms.
Autism spectrum disorder includes conditions that were once thought to be separate — autism, Asperger's syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and a form of widespread developmental disorder that isn't specified.
Autism spectrum disorder begins in early childhood. Over time, it can cause difficulty functioning in society. For example, people with autism spectrum disorder may have problems being social or when in school or at work. Often children show symptoms of autism within the first year of life. A small number of children with the condition appear to develop as expected in the first year. Then between 18 and 24 months of age, they may lose some skills and develop autism symptoms.
There is no cure for autism spectrum disorder. But getting treatment early, during the preschool years, can make a big difference in the lives of many children with the condition.","Some children show signs of autism spectrum disorder in early infancy, such as less eye contact, not responding to their names or not being interested in caregivers. Other children may not develop as expected for the first few months or years of life. Then they suddenly become withdrawn or aggressive or lose the language skills they had before. Signs usually are seen by ages 2 to 3 years old.
Some people in the mild range on the autism spectrum may have more symptoms that aren't noticed early on. They may not be diagnosed until middle to late childhood, when there is a greater need to communicate and be social. Sometimes a diagnosis is made for the first time in adulthood, though symptoms were likely present during childhood.
Each child with autism spectrum disorder is likely to have a unique pattern of behavior that depends on whether symptoms are mild, moderate or severe.
Some children with autism spectrum disorder have trouble learning, and some have signs of lower than usual intelligence. Other children with the condition have usual to high intelligence. These children learn quickly but have trouble communicating, applying what they know in everyday life and adjusting to social situations.
Because each child can have a unique mix of symptoms, sometimes it can be hard to tell how severe the condition is. It's generally based on how severe the symptoms are and how much those symptoms affect a child being able to function.
Below are some common signs shown by people who have autism spectrum disorder.","Babies develop at their own pace, and many don't follow exact timelines found in some parenting books. But children with autism spectrum disorder usually show some signs of delayed development before they're 3 years old. Signs of autism spectrum disorder often appear early in development when there are obvious delays in language skills and social interactions.
If you're concerned about your child's development or think that your child may have autism spectrum disorder, talk with a healthcare professional about your concerns. Your healthcare professional may recommend developmental tests to figure out if your child has delays in learning, thinking, language or social skills that point to autism spectrum disorder or another type of developmental condition.","Autism spectrum disorder has no single known cause. Since the condition is complex and symptoms and severity vary, there could be many causes. Both genetics and the environment may play a role.
Genetics.Several genes seem to be involved in autism spectrum disorder. For some children, autism spectrum disorder can be related to a genetic condition, such as Rett syndrome or fragile X syndrome. For other children, genetic changes, also known as mutations, may raise the risk of autism spectrum disorder. Still other genes may affect the way that the brain develops or brain cells communicate. Or those genes may affect how severe symptoms are. While some genetic changes seem to be inherited, others aren't.
Environmental factors.Researchers are exploring whether factors such as viral infections, medicines, complications during pregnancy or air pollutants play a role in causing autism spectrum disorder.","The number of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder is rising. It isn't clear whether this is due to better ways to diagnose and report the condition, a real increase in the number of children with the condition, or both.
Autism spectrum disorder affects children of all races and nationalities. But certain factors raise a child's risk, including:
Your child's sex.Boys are about four times more likely to be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder than girls are. While boys may get autism spectrum disorder more often than girls, it's possible that some girls aren't diagnosed.
Family history.Families who have one child with autism spectrum disorder have a higher risk of having another child with the condition. Sometimes parents or relatives of a child with autism spectrum disorder may have minor problems being social or communicating, or they may show certain behaviors typical of the condition.
Other conditions.Children with certain medical conditions have a higher risk of autism spectrum disorder or symptoms similar to autism. Examples include fragile X syndrome, an inherited condition that causes intellectual disability; tuberous sclerosis, a condition in which benign tumors develop in the brain; and Rett syndrome, a genetic condition that almost always occurs in girls and causes slowing of head growth, intellectual disability and loss of purposeful hand use.
Early birth.Babies born before 26 weeks of a parent's pregnancy may have a higher risk of autism spectrum disorder.
Parents' ages.There may be a connection between children born to older parents and autism spectrum disorder. But more research is needed to show this link.","Because people with autism spectrum disorder often have a hard time interacting socially, communicating or behaving, this can lead to problems with:
School and learning.
Getting a job.
Not being able to live on their own.
Being isolated socially.
Stress within the family.
Being a victim and being bullied.","There's no known way to prevent autism spectrum disorder. But many studies have been done to see if taking folic acid and other vitamins before and during pregnancy can lower the risk of having a baby with autism spectrum disorder. A review of studies on what are known as prenatal vitamins shows no clear answer. This is due to the quality of the research. More high-quality studies are needed.
Getting diagnosed and treated early is most helpful in improving behavior, skills and language development. But getting treatment is helpful at any age. Though children usually don't outgrow autism spectrum disorder symptoms, they may learn to function well.","Your child's healthcare professional looks for signs of developmental delays at regular well-child checkups. If your child shows any symptoms of autism, you'll likely be referred to a specialist who treats children with autism spectrum disorder for an evaluation. This specialist could be a child psychiatrist or psychologist, a pediatric neurologist, or a developmental pediatrician.
Because autism spectrum disorder symptoms and how severe they are can vary widely, it may be hard to make a diagnosis. There is no specific medical test to diagnose autism spectrum disorder. Instead, a specialist may:
Observe your child and ask how your child has developed or changed over time in terms of interacting socially, communicating and behaving.
Give your child tests covering hearing, speech, language, level of development, and social and behavioral issues.
Present structured social and communication interactions to your child and score the performance.
Include other specialists in coming up with a diagnosis.
Recommend genetic testing to figure out whether your child has a genetic condition such as Rett syndrome or fragile X syndrome.","There is no cure for autism spectrum disorder, and there is no one-size-fits-all treatment. Treatment seeks to support your child's learning, development and behavior. Getting treated early, during the preschool years, can help your child learn critical social, communication, functional and behavioral skills.
The range of home-based and school-based treatments for autism spectrum disorder can be overwhelming, and your child's needs may change over time. Your healthcare professional can recommend options and help find resources in your area.
If your child is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, talk with experts about creating a treatment strategy and build a team of health professionals to meet your child's needs.
Treatment options may include:
Behavior and communication therapies.Many programs address the range of social, language and behavioral difficulties linked with autism spectrum disorder. Some programs focus on reducing challenging behaviors and teaching new skills. Other programs focus on teaching children how to act in social situations or communicate better with others. Applied behavior analysis can help children learn new skills and adapt these skills to many situations by motivating them with rewards.
Educational therapies.Children with autism spectrum disorder often respond well to highly structured educational programs. Successful programs usually include a team of specialists and various activities to improve social skills, communication and behavior. Preschool children who get intensive, individualized behavioral treatments often show good progress.
Family therapies.Parents and other family members can learn how to play and interact with children who have autism in ways that support social interaction skills, manage challenging behaviors, and teach daily living skills and communication.
Other therapies.Depending on your child's needs, speech therapy to make communication skills better, occupational therapy to teach activities of daily living, and physical therapy to make movement and balance better may help. A psychologist can recommend ways to manage problem behavior.
Medicines.Medicine can't make the core signs of autism spectrum disorder better, but specific medicines can help control symptoms. For example, certain medicines may be prescribed if your child is hyperactive. Sometimes healthcare professionals prescribe antipsychotic medicines to treat severe behavioral symptoms. Or they may prescribe antidepressants for anxiety. Keep all healthcare professionals updated on any medicines or supplements your child takes. Some medicines and supplements can affect how one medicine acts with another, causing dangerous side effects.","Raising a child with autism spectrum disorder can tire you physically and drain you emotionally. These suggestions may help:
Find a team of trusted health professionals and others.A team, coordinated by your healthcare professional, may include social workers, teachers, therapists, and a case manager or service coordinator. Team members can help find and assess the resources in your area. They also can explain financial services and state and federal programs for children and adults with disabilities.
Keep records of visits with healthcare professionals.Your child may have visits, evaluations and meetings with many people on the care team. Keep an organized file of these meetings and reports to help you decide about treatment options and watch progress.
Learn about the disorder.There are many stories and beliefs that are not true about autism spectrum disorder. Learning the truth can help you better understand your child and attempts to communicate.
Take time for yourself and other family members.Caring for a child with autism spectrum disorder can put stress on your personal relationships and your family. To avoid burnout, take time out to relax, exercise or enjoy your favorite activities. Try to schedule one-on-one time with your other children and plan date nights with your spouse or partner — even if it's just watching a movie together after the children go to bed.
Seek out other families of children with autism spectrum disorder.Other families managing the challenges of autism spectrum disorder may have useful advice. Some communities have support groups for parents and siblings of children with the disorder.
Ask your healthcare professional about new technologies and therapies.Researchers continue to explore new ways to help children with autism spectrum disorder. See the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website on autism spectrum disorder for helpful materials and links to resources.","Your child's healthcare professional looks for developmental issues at regular checkups. Mention any concerns you have during your appointment. If your child shows any signs of autism spectrum disorder, your child likely will be referred for an evaluation by a specialist who treats children with the condition.
Bring a family member or friend with you to the appointment, if possible, to help you remember information and for emotional support.

Also called osteonecrosis, it can lead to tiny breaks in the bone and cause the bone to collapse. The process usually takes months to years.

A broken bone or dislocated joint can stop the blood flow to a section of bone. Avascular necrosis is also associated with long-term use of high-dose steroid medications and too much alcohol.

Anyone can be affected. But the condition is most common in people between the ages of 30 and 50.","Some people have no symptoms in the early stages of avascular necrosis. As the condition worsens, affected joints might hurt only when putting weight on them. Eventually, you might feel the pain even when you're lying down.

Pain can be mild or severe. It usually develops gradually. Pain associated with avascular necrosis of the hip might center on the groin, thigh or buttock. Besides the hip, the shoulder, knee, hand and foot can be affected.

Some people develop avascular necrosis on both sides, such as in both hips or in both knees.",See your health care provider for ongoing pain in any joint. Seek immediate medical attention for a possible broken bone or dislocated joint.,"Avascular necrosis occurs when blood flow to a bone is interrupted or reduced. Reduced blood supply can be caused by:

Sometimes the cause of avascular necrosis not brought on by trauma isn't fully understood. Genetics combined with overuse of alcohol, certain medications and other diseases likely play a role.","Risk factors for developing avascular necrosis include:

Medical conditions associated with avascular necrosis include:","Untreated, avascular necrosis worsens. Eventually, the bone can collapse. Avascular necrosis also causes bone to lose its smooth shape, possibly leading to severe arthritis.",To reduce the risk of avascular necrosis and improve general health:,"During a physical exam, a health care provider will press around your joints, checking for tenderness. They might also move the joints through different positions to see if the range of motion is lessened.",The goal is to prevent further bone loss.,,Your health care provider might refer you to a doctor who specializes in disorders of the joints (rheumatologist) or to an orthopedic surgeon.,
Childhood asthma,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/childhood-asthma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351507,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/childhood-asthma/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351513,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/childhood-asthma/doctors-departments/ddc-20351517,"In childhood asthma, the lungs and airways become easily inflamed when exposed to certain triggers. Such triggers include inhaling pollen or catching a cold or other respiratory infection. Childhood asthma can cause irritating daily symptoms that interfere with play, sports, school and sleep. In some children, unmanaged asthma can cause dangerous asthma attacks.

Childhood asthma isn't a different disease from asthma in adults, but children face unique challenges. The condition is a leading cause of emergency department visits, hospitalizations and missed school days.

Unfortunately, childhood asthma can't be cured, and symptoms can continue into adulthood. But with the right treatment, you and your child can keep symptoms under control and prevent damage to growing lungs.","Common childhood asthma symptoms include:

Childhood asthma also might cause:

Asthma symptoms vary from child to child and might get worse or better over time. Your child might have only one symptom, such as a lingering cough or chest congestion.

It can be difficult to tell whether your child's symptoms are caused by asthma. Wheezing and other asthma-like symptoms can be caused by infectious bronchitis or another respiratory problem.","Take your child to see a health care provider if you suspect that your child has asthma. Early treatment will help control symptoms and possibly prevent asthma attacks.

Make an appointment with your child's provider if you notice:

Children who have asthma may say things such as, ""My chest feels funny"" or ""I'm always coughing."" Listen for coughing in children, which might not wake them, when they are asleep. Crying, laughing, yelling, or strong emotional reactions and stress also might trigger coughing or wheezing.

If your child is diagnosed with asthma, creating an asthma plan can help you and other caregivers monitor symptoms and know what to do if an asthma attack occurs.","Childhood asthma causes aren't fully understood. Some factors thought to be involved include having:

Increased immune system sensitivity causes the lungs and airways to swell and produce mucus when exposed to certain triggers. Reaction to a trigger can be delayed, making it more difficult to identify the trigger. Triggers vary from child to child and can include:

Sometimes, asthma symptoms occur with no apparent triggers.",Factors that might increase your child's chance of developing asthma include:,"Asthma can cause a number of complications, including:","Careful planning and avoiding asthma triggers are the best ways to prevent asthma attacks.

See your child's health care provider when necessary.Check in regularly. Don't ignore signs that your child's asthma might not be under control, such as needing to use a quick-relief inhaler too often.

Asthma changes over time. Consulting your child's provider can help you make needed treatment adjustments to control symptoms.","Asthma can be hard to diagnose. Your child's health care provider considers the symptoms and their frequency and your child's medical history. Your child might need tests to rule out other conditions and to identify the most likely cause of the symptoms.

A number of childhood conditions can have symptoms similar to those caused by asthma. To complicate the diagnosis further, these conditions also commonly occur with asthma. So your child's provider will have to determine whether your child's symptoms are caused by asthma, a condition other than asthma, or both asthma and another condition.

Conditions that can cause asthma-like symptoms include:

Your child may need the following tests:

Lung function tests, also called spirometry.Health care providers diagnose asthma in children with the same tests used to identify the disease in adults. Spirometry measures how much air your child can exhale and how quickly. Your child might have lung function tests at rest, after exercising and after taking asthma medicine.

Another lung function test is brochoprovocation. Using spirometry, this test measures how the lungs react to certain provocations, such as exercise or exposure to cold air.

These asthma tests aren't accurate before 5 years of age, however. For younger children, your provider will rely on information you and your child provide about symptoms. Sometimes a diagnosis can't be made until later, after months or even years of observing symptoms.","Initial treatment depends on the severity of your child's asthma. The goal of asthma treatment is to keep symptoms under control, meaning that your child has:

Treating asthma involves both preventing symptoms and treating an asthma attack in progress. The right medicine for your child depends on a few things, including:

For children younger than age 3 who have mild symptoms of asthma, your provider might use a wait-and-see approach. This is because the long-term effects of asthma medicine in infants and young children aren't clear.

However, if an infant or toddler has frequent or severe wheezing episodes, a health care provider might prescribe a medicine to see if it improves symptoms.","It can be stressful to help your child manage asthma. Keep these tips in mind to make life as easy as possible:

Use a written asthma action plan.Work with your child's health care provider to develop your child's action plan, and give a copy to all of your child's caregivers, such as child care providers, teachers, coaches and the parents of your child's friends.

Following a written plan can help you and your child identify symptoms early, providing important information on how to treat your child's asthma from day to day and how to deal with an asthma attack.

Be encouraging.Focus attention on what your child can do, not on limitations. Involve teachers, school nurses, coaches, relatives and friends in helping your child manage asthma.

Encourage typical play and activity. Don't limit your child's activities out of fear of an asthma attack — work with your child's provider to control exercise-induced symptoms.","You're likely to start by taking your child to your primary health care provider or your child's pediatrician. However, when you call to set up an appointment, you may be referred to an allergist, a lung doctor, called a pulmonologist, or another specialist.

It causes shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and other symptoms during or after exercise.

The medical term for this condition is exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (brong-koh-kun-STRIK-shun). Many people with asthma have exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. But people without asthma also can have it.

Most people with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction can continue to exercise and remain active if they treat symptoms. Treatment includes asthma medicines and taking steps to prevent symptoms before physical activity starts.",Symptoms of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction usually begin during or soon after exercise. These symptoms can last for an hour or longer if untreated. Symptoms include:,"See your health care provider if you have symptoms of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. A few conditions can cause similar symptoms, so it's important to get a diagnosis as soon as you can.

However, recent studies found dry air to be a more likely culprit. Cold air contains less moisture than warm air. Breathing in cold, dry air dehydrates the air passages. This causes them to constrict, reducing air flow. Other factors, such as chlorine or other fumes, can irritate the lining of the airways and contribute to breathing difficulties as well.","Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is more likely to occur in:

These substances can trigger an immune system response that changes how the lungs work. Occupational asthma also is called work-related asthma.
In asthma, the airways narrow and swell. They also may make extra mucus. This makes it difficult to breathe and may cause chest tightness, wheezing and shortness of breath.
Avoiding triggers is important for managing occupational asthma. Treatment includes medicines that reduce symptoms. For people who were diagnosed with asthma in the past, medicines may help improve symptoms related to workplace triggers.
If occupational asthma is not treated and triggers are not avoided, the asthma can cause permanent changes to the lungs.","Occupational asthma symptoms may include:
Wheezing.
Coughing.
Shortness of breath.
Chest tightness.
Other possible symptoms may include:
Runny nose.
Stuffy nose.
Itchy or watery eyes.
Occupational asthma symptoms depend on the substance you're exposed to, how long and how often you're exposed, and other factors. Your symptoms may:
Begin right after exposure to a substance, later in the day or after work.
Improve or go away on days off or during vacations and then return when you go to work.
May begin early in the day and fail to improve on days off as disease progresses.
May become permanent even after long periods away from work.","Seek medical treatment right away if your symptoms worsen. Severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening. Symptoms of an asthma attack that need emergency treatment include:
Shortness of breath or wheezing that quickly gets worse.
No easing of symptoms after using a quick-relief medicine.
Shortness of breath even with little activity.
Make an appointment to see your healthcare professional if you have breathing problems, such as coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath, especially if the symptoms don't go away or worsen.","More than 400 workplace substances have been identified as possible triggers of occupational asthma. These substances include:
Animal proteinsfound in dander, hair, scales, fur, saliva and body wastes.
Chemicalsused to make paints, varnishes, adhesives, laminates and soldering resin. Other examples include chemicals used to make insulation, packaging materials, and foam mattresses and upholstery.
Enzymesused in detergents and baking flour.
Metals,particularly platinum, chromium and nickel sulfate.
Plant substances,including proteins found in natural rubber latex, flour, cereals, cotton, flax, hemp, rye, wheat and papaya.
Irritating gases or particles,such as chlorine gas, sulfur dioxide and smoke.
Asthma symptoms start when your lungs become irritated. This irritation causes an immune system reaction called inflammation. Inflammation is defined as swelling and other changes in airway tissues caused by immune system activity. These changes narrow the airways and make it difficult to breathe.
With occupational asthma, lung inflammation may be triggered by a substance that a person is allergic to, such as mold or an animal protein. Sometimes lung inflammation is triggered by an irritating substance, also called an irritant, such as chlorine or smoke.","The more you're exposed to an irritant, the greater the risk of developing occupational asthma. In addition, you will have increased risk if:
You have existing allergies or asthma.Although this can increase your risk, many people who have allergies or asthma do jobs that expose them to lung irritants and never have symptoms.
Other family members have allergies or asthma.Your parents may pass down genes that make it more likely for you to develop asthma.
You work around known asthma triggers.Some substances are known to be lung irritants and asthma triggers.
You smoke.Smoking increases your risk of developing asthma if you are exposed to certain types of irritants.","The longer you're exposed to a substance that can cause occupational asthma, the worse your symptoms may become. Also, the longer you're exposed, the longer it will take for symptoms to improve after exposure stops. In some cases, exposure to airborne asthma triggers can cause permanent changes to your lungs.","The best way to prevent occupational asthma is to control exposure to chemicals and other substances that are known to be irritating. Workplaces can set up controls to prevent exposures, use less harmful substances and provide personal protective equipment (PPE) for workers.
Medicines may help relieve symptoms and control inflammation linked to occupational asthma. But you can do several things on your own to be healthy and lessen the possibility of attacks:
If you smoke, quit.Being smoke-free may help prevent or lessen symptoms of occupational asthma.
Get a flu vaccination.This can help prevent illness that affects the lungs.
Avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)and other medicines that may make symptoms worse. Ask your healthcare professional about medicines you take regularly.
Lose weight.For people with obesity, losing weight can help improve symptoms and overall lung health.
If you are in the United States and you have a high-risk job, your company must follow rules to help protect you from harmful chemicals. Under guidelines from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), your employer is required to do the following:
Tell youif you'll be working with any harmful chemicals.
Train youhow to safely handle these chemicals.
Train youhow to respond to an emergency, such as a chemical spill.
Supply protective gear,such as masks and respirators.
Offer extra trainingwhen a new chemical is used at your workplace.
UnderOSHAguidelines, your employer is required to keep a material safety data sheet (MSDS) for each harmful chemical used in your workplace. This is a document that must be submitted by the chemical's manufacturer to your employer. You have a legal right to see and copy such documents. If you suspect you're allergic to a certain substance, show theMSDSto your healthcare professional.
While at work, watch for conditions that may not be safe or healthy. Report concerns to your supervisor. If necessary, callOSHAat800-321-OSHA(800-321-6742) and ask for an on-site inspection. You can do this so that your name won't be revealed to your employer.","Diagnosing occupational asthma is similar to diagnosing other types of asthma. However, your healthcare professional also will try to identify whether a workplace substance is causing your symptoms and what substance is causing problems.
An asthma diagnosis needs to be confirmed with a test called a lung function test. This test shows how well your lungs work. An allergy skin prick test can show if you have allergic reactions to some allergy-causing substances. Blood tests, X-rays or other tests may be necessary to rule out a cause other than occupational asthma.","The goal of treatment is to prevent symptoms and stop an asthma attack in progress.
Avoiding the workplace substance that causes your symptoms is important. Once you become sensitive to a substance, tiny amounts may trigger asthma symptoms, even if you wear a mask or respirator.
You may need medicines for successful treatment. The same medicines are used to treat both occupational and nonoccupational asthma.
The right medicine for you depends on many things. These include your age, symptoms, asthma triggers and what seems to work best to keep your asthma under control.",,"You're likely to start by seeing your primary healthcare professional.

Atrial tachycardia,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-tachycardia/symptoms-causes/syc-20573298,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-tachycardia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20573299,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-tachycardia/doctors-departments/ddc-20573300,"Atrial tachycardia is an irregular heartbeat, called an arrhythmia. It's a type of supraventricular tachycardia.
During an atrial tachycardia episode, the heart beats more than 100 times a minute. Then it returns to a heart rate of around 60 to 80 beats a minute. An episode may start slowly, or it may start suddenly and quickly. It can cause a pounding or racing heartbeat, lightheadedness, dizziness, and fainting.
Atrial tachycardia is common. It may happen in people who have had heart surgery or who are pregnant. Infections, stimulant medicines or alcohol use may trigger it.","The main symptom of atrial tachycardia is a very fast heartbeat. Typically during atrial tachycardia, the heart beats 150 to 200 times a minute. The fast heartbeat may come and go suddenly, or it can be ongoing.
Other symptoms of atrial tachycardia may include:
Pounding or fluttering feelings in the chest or neck, called palpitations.
Chest pain.
Fainting or almost fainting.
Lightheadedness or dizziness.
Shortness of breath.
Sweating.
Weakness or extreme tiredness.
Nausea.
Some people with atrial tachycardia do not notice symptoms.
Atrial tachycardia symptoms may be hard to see in infants and young children. Symptoms of atrial tachycardia in children can include:
Poor feeding.
Sweating.
Irritability.
Changes in skin color.
If your infant or young child has any of these symptoms, talk with a healthcare professional.","Symptoms of atrial tachycardia may be related to a serious health condition. Call 911 or your local emergency number if you have a very fast heartbeat that lasts for more than a few minutes or if a fast heartbeat occurs with these symptoms:
Chest pain.
Dizziness.
Shortness of breath.
Weakness.
Make an appointment for a healthcare checkup if you have:
A very fast heartbeat for the first time.
An irregular heartbeat that lasts longer than a few seconds.","Atrial tachycardia is caused by faulty electrical signals in the heart. These electrical signals control the heartbeat.
In atrial tachycardia, a change in these signals makes the heartbeat start too early in the heart's upper chambers. This causes the heart to beat too fast. Then the heart is not able to fill with blood properly.","Anyone can get atrial tachycardia. But some health conditions or treatments can increase your risk. Atrial tachycardia risk factors include:
Heart conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart valve disease and other heart diseases.
Heart failure.
Heart condition present at birth, called a congenital heart defect.
Previous heart surgery.
Sleep apnea.
Thyroid disease.
Lung disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Diabetes.
Some medicines, including those used to treat asthma, allergies and colds.
Other things that may increase the risk of atrial tachycardia include:
Emotional stress.
Too much caffeine.
Heavy alcohol use, defined as more than 15 drinks a week for men and eight or more drinks a week for women.
Smoking and nicotine use.
Stimulant drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine.","Atrial tachycardia isn't usually life-threatening. However, it can be a concern if you have heart damage or another heart condition. If the very fast heartbeat continues, it may weaken the heart muscle.",,"To diagnose atrial tachycardia, a healthcare professional examines you and listens to your heart. A member of your healthcare team takes your blood pressure. You are usually asked questions about your symptoms, health habits and medical history.","Treatment of atrial tachycardia depends on what causes it and how severe it is. Treatment may include:
Vagal maneuvers.Simple but specific actions such as coughing, putting an ice pack on the face or pushing down as if having a bowel movement can help slow down the heart rate. These actions affect the vagus nerve, which helps control the heartbeat.
Medicines.Medicines may be given to control the heart rate and reset the heart rhythm. Some medicines may need to be given byIV.
Cardioversion.Paddles or patches on the chest are used to give an electrical shock to the heart. The quick, low-energy shock resets the heart's rhythm. This may be a treatment option if atrial tachycardia doesn't get better with vagal maneuvers or medicine.
Catheter ablation.A doctor guides a thin, flexible tube called a catheter through a blood vessel, usually in the groin, and up to the heart. Sometimes more than one catheter is used. Sensors on the tip of the catheter use heat energy, called radiofrequency energy, to create tiny scars in the heart. The scar tissue blocks faulty electrical signals. This restores a regular heartbeat.
Pacemaker.A pacemaker is a small device that's placed in the chest to help control the heartbeat. When it finds an irregular heartbeat, it sends an electrical signal that helps correct the heart's rhythm. A pacemaker may be needed if other treatments for atrial tachycardia don't work. For people with atrial tachycardia, a pacemaker is typically placed during with a treatment calledAVnode ablation.",,"If you have a very fast heartbeat, call your healthcare professional. If the fast heartbeat is severe and lasts longer than a few minutes, seek immediate medical help.
Your healthcare professional may send you to a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist. You also might see a doctor trained in heart rhythm disorders, called an electrophysiologist.

Arteriosclerosis / atherosclerosis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350575,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/doctors-departments/ddc-20350578,"Arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis are sometimes used to mean the same thing. But there's a difference between the two terms.
Arteriosclerosishappens when the blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients from the heart to the rest of the body become thick and stiff. These blood vessels are called arteries. Healthy arteries are flexible and elastic. But over time, the walls in the arteries can harden, a condition commonly called hardening of the arteries.
Atherosclerosisis a specific type of arteriosclerosis.
Atherosclerosis is the buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls. This buildup is called plaque. The plaque can cause arteries to narrow, blocking blood flow. The plaque also can burst, leading to a blood clot.
Although atherosclerosis is often considered a heart condition, it can affect arteries anywhere in the body. Atherosclerosis can be treated. Healthy lifestyle habits can help prevent atherosclerosis.","Mild atherosclerosis usually doesn't cause symptoms.
Atherosclerosis symptoms usually don't happen until an artery is so narrowed or clogged that it can't send enough blood to organs and tissues. Sometimes a blood clot completely blocks blood flow. The clot may break apart. If this happens, it may cause a heart attack or stroke.
Symptoms of moderate to severe atherosclerosis depend on which arteries are affected. For example, if you have atherosclerosis:
In your heart arteries,you may have chest pain or pressure, called angina.
In the arteries leading to your brain,you may have sudden numbness or weakness in your arms or legs, trouble speaking, slurred speech, sudden or temporary loss of vision in one eye, or drooping muscles in your face. These are symptoms of a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Untreated, a TIA can lead to a stroke.
In the arteries in your arms and legs,you may have leg pain when walking, called claudication. This is a symptom of peripheral artery disease (PAD). You also might have lower blood pressure in the affected arm or leg.
In the arteries leading to your kidneys,you may get high blood pressure or kidney failure.","If you think you have atherosclerosis, make an appointment for a health checkup. Early diagnosis and treatment can stop atherosclerosis from getting worse. Treatment may prevent a heart attack, stroke or another medical emergency.
Get emergency medical help if you have chest pain or symptoms of transient ischemic attack or stroke such as:
Sudden numbness or weakness in the arms or legs.
Trouble speaking.
Slurred speech.
Sudden or temporary loss of vision in one eye.
Drooping face muscles.","Atherosclerosis is a disease that slowly gets worse. It may begin as early as childhood. The exact cause is not known. It may start with damage or injury to the inner layer of an artery. Artery damage may be caused by:
High blood pressure.
High cholesterol.
High triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood.
Smoking or other tobacco use.
Diabetes.
Insulin resistance.
Obesity.
Inflammation from an unknown cause or from diseases such as arthritis, lupus, psoriasis or inflammatory bowel disease.
Once the inner wall of an artery is damaged, blood cells and other substances may collect at the injury site. These substances build up in the inner lining of the artery.
Over time, fats, cholesterol and other substances also collect on and in the walls of the heart arteries. This buildup is called plaque. Plaque can cause the arteries to narrow. Narrowed arteries can block blood flow. The plaque also can burst, leading to a blood clot.","Risk factors for atherosclerosis that you can't control include:
Aging.
A family history of early heart disease or stroke.
Changes in genes that make atherosclerosis more likely.
Having inflammatory conditions such as lupus, inflammatory bowel disease or psoriasis.
Risk factors for atherosclerosis that you may be able to control include:
An unhealthy diet.
Diabetes.
High blood pressure.
High cholesterol.
Lack of exercise.
Obesity.
Sleep apnea.
Smoking and other tobacco use.","The complications of atherosclerosis depend on which arteries are narrowed or blocked. For example:
Coronary artery disease.Atherosclerosis in the arteries close to the heart can lead to coronary artery disease. This may cause chest pain, a heart attack or heart failure.
Carotid artery disease.This is atherosclerosis in the arteries close to the brain. Complications include a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke.
Peripheral artery disease.This is atherosclerosis in the arteries in the arms or legs. Complications include blocked or changed blood flow in the affected areas. Rarely, the lack of blood flow may cause tissue death, called gangrene.
Aneurysms.Sometimes atherosclerosis can form a bulge in the wall of an artery. This is called an aneurysm. An aneurysm can occur anywhere in the body. Most people with aneurysms have no symptoms. If an aneurysm bursts, it can cause life-threatening bleeding inside the body.
Chronic kidney disease.Atherosclerosis can cause the arteries leading to the kidneys to narrow. This prevents the kidneys from getting enough oxygen-rich blood. The kidneys need the blood flow to help remove fluids and waste products from the body.","The same healthy lifestyle changes recommended to treat atherosclerosis also help prevent it. These lifestyle changes can help keep the arteries healthy:
Do not smoke or use tobacco.
Eat nutritious foods.
Get regular exercise and keep an active lifestyle.
Keep a healthy weight.
Control blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol.","To diagnose atherosclerosis, your healthcare professional examines you and listens to your heart. You usually are asked questions about your symptoms and your family health history. You may be sent to a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist.
Your healthcare professional may hear a whooshing sound when listening to your heart with a stethoscope.","Treatment of atherosclerosis may include:
Lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet and getting more exercise.
Medicines.
Heart procedure.
Heart surgery.
For some people, lifestyle changes may be the only treatment needed for atherosclerosis.",,"If you think you may have atherosclerosis or if you have a family history of heart disease, make an appointment for a health checkup. Ask if you need a cholesterol test.
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.","Lifestyle changes can help keep the arteries healthy. They also can prevent or slow atherosclerosis. The American Heart Association recommends these eight heart-healthy tips:
Don't smoke, vape or use tobacco.Also stay away from cigarette smoke. Smoking damages the arteries. Smoking is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease. Nicotine tightens blood vessels and forces the heart to work harder. Not smoking is one of the best ways to lower the risk of atherosclerosis complications, such as a heart attack.
Get regular exercise.Staying active keeps the body healthy. Exercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week. Talk with your healthcare team about the amount and type of exercise that's best for you.
Keep a healthy weight.Being overweight increases the risk of coronary artery disease, which is caused by atherosclerosis. Losing even a small amount of weight can help reduce the risk. Ask your healthcare professional what weight is best for you.
Eat healthy foods.Choose fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Limit salt and saturated fats. Read nutrition labels to check the amount of salt and fat.
Manage stress.Find ways to help reduce stress. Some ideas are to get more exercise, practice mindfulness and connect with others in support groups. Or try yoga or deep breathing. These relaxation practices can temporarily lower blood pressure, reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis.
Control blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol.Make lifestyle changes and take medicines as directed. Get regular health checkups.
Limit alcohol.If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.
Get good sleep.Poor sleep may increase the risk of heart disease and other health conditions. Adults should aim for 7 to 9 hours daily."
Atrioventricular canal defect,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrioventricular-canal-defect/symptoms-causes/syc-20361492,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrioventricular-canal-defect/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20361528,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrioventricular-canal-defect/doctors-departments/ddc-20362272,"Atrioventricular septal defect is a mix of problems affecting the center of the heart. The heart condition is present at birth. That means it's a congenital heart defect. Children born with this condition have a hole in the wall between the heart's chambers. They also have problems with the valves that control blood flow in the heart.

Atrioventricular septal defect allows extra blood to flow to the lungs. The extra blood forces the heart to work too hard, causing the heart muscle to grow larger.

Untreated, atrioventricular septal defect can cause heart failure and high blood pressure in the lungs. Treatment usually involves surgery during the first year of life to close the hole in the heart and to repair the valves.

Other names for this condition are:","Atrioventricular canal defect can involve only the two upper chambers of the heart or all four chambers. In both types, extra blood flows into the lungs. Symptoms depend on whether the defect is partial or complete.",,Atrioventricular canal defect occurs before birth when a baby's heart is developing. Experts aren't sure of the cause. Having Down syndrome might increase the risk.,Things that might increase the risk of atrioventricular canal defect include:,"Possible complications of atrioventricular canal defect include:

Treatment greatly improves the outlook for children with atrioventricular canal defect. But complications may still occur later in life. They may include:","There is no known prevention for atrioventricular canal defect.

Some heart problems are passed down in families, which means they are inherited. If you have a family or personal history of congenital heart disease, talk with a genetic counselor and a cardiologist before getting pregnant.","Atrioventricular canal defect might be diagnosed in a baby before birth during a pregnancy ultrasound or special heart imaging.

After birth, symptoms of complete atrioventricular canal defect are usually noticeable within the first weeks. When listening to a baby's heart, a health care provider might hear a whooshing sound. The sound is called a heart murmur.

Tests to diagnose atrioventricular canal defect may include:","Surgery is needed to treat a complete or partial atrioventricular canal defect. More than one surgery may be needed. Surgery involves using one or two patches to close the hole in the heart wall. The patches stay in the heart. They become part of the heart's wall as the heart's lining grows over them.

Other surgeries depend on whether the defect is partial or complete and what other heart problems exist.

For a partial atrioventricular canal defect, surgery to repair the mitral valve is needed so that the valve will close tightly. If repair isn't possible, the valve might need to be replaced.

For a complete atrioventricular canal defect, surgeons separate the large single valve between the upper and lower heart chambers into two valves. If this isn't possible, the mitral and tricuspid valves might need to be replaced.

Many people who have corrective surgery for atrioventricular canal defect don't need more surgery. However, some complications, such as heart valve leaks, may require treatment.","Many children with heart problems present at birth grow up to lead healthy lives.

But having a congenital heart defect or caring for a child with one can be challenging. These tips may be helpful.","You or your child might be referred to a doctor trained in heart conditions, called a cardiologist.",

Vaginal atrophy occurs most often after menopause.

For many women, vaginal atrophy not only makes intercourse painful but also leads to distressing urinary symptoms. Because the condition causes both vaginal and urinary symptoms, doctors use the term ""genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)"" to describe vaginal atrophy and its accompanying symptoms.

Simple, effective treatments for genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) are available. Reduced estrogen levels result in changes to your body, but it doesn't mean you have to live with the discomfort ofGSM.",Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) signs and symptoms may include:,"Many postmenopausal women experienceGSM. But few seek treatment. Women may be embarrassed to discuss their symptoms with their doctor and may resign themselves to living with these symptoms.

Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any unexplained vaginal spotting or bleeding, unusual discharge, burning, or soreness.

Also make an appointment to see your doctor if you experience painful intercourse that's not resolved by using a vaginal moisturizer (K-Y Liquibeads, Replens, Sliquid, others) or water-based lubricant (Astroglide, K-Y Jelly, Sliquid, others).","Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is caused by a decrease in estrogen production. Less estrogen makes your vaginal tissues thinner, drier, less elastic and more fragile.

A drop in estrogen levels may occur:

Reactive attachment disorder,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/reactive-attachment-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20352939,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/reactive-attachment-disorder/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352945,,"Reactive attachment disorder is a rare but serious condition in which an infant or young child doesn't establish healthy attachments with parents or caregivers. Reactive attachment disorder may develop if the child's basic needs for comfort, affection and nurturing aren't met and loving, caring, stable attachments with others are not established.

With appropriate treatment, children who have reactive attachment disorder may develop more stable and healthy relationships with caregivers and others. Treatments for reactive attachment disorder include learning how to create a stable, nurturing environment and providing positive child and caregiver interactions. Parent or caregiver counseling and education can help.","Reactive attachment disorder usually starts in infancy. There's little research on signs and symptoms of reactive attachment disorder beyond early childhood, and it remains uncertain whether it occurs in children older than 5 years.

Signs and symptoms may include:","Consider getting an evaluation if your child shows any concerning signs that persist across time. Some signs can occur in children who don't have reactive attachment disorder or who have another disorder, such as autism spectrum disorder. Sometimes young children may display some temporary signs and symptoms, but they tend to be brief, minor or don't cause developmental problems. It's important to have your child evaluated by a pediatric psychiatrist or psychologist who can determine whether behaviors indicate a more serious problem.","To feel safe and develop trust, infants and young children need a stable, caring environment. Their basic emotional and physical needs must be consistently met by caregivers. For instance, when a baby cries, the need for comfort, a meal or a diaper change must be met with a shared emotional exchange that may include eye contact, smiling and caressing.

A child whose needs are ignored or who is met with a lack of emotional response from caregivers does not come to expect care or comfort or form a stable attachment to caregivers.

It's not clear why some babies and children develop reactive attachment disorder and others don't. Various theories about reactive attachment disorder and its causes exist, and more research is needed to develop a better understanding and improve diagnosis and treatment options.","The risk of developing reactive attachment disorder from severe social and emotional neglect or the lack of opportunity to develop stable attachments may increase in children who, for example:

However, most children who are severely neglected don't develop reactive attachment disorder.","Without proper treatment, reactive attachment disorder can continue for several years and may have lifelong consequences. These can include problems with relationships, social interactions, mental and physical health, behavior, intellectual development, and substance abuse.

More research is needed to determine if problems in older children and adults are related to experiences of reactive attachment disorder in early childhood.","While it's not known with certainty if reactive attachment disorder can be prevented, there may be ways to reduce the risk of its development. Infants and young children need a stable, caring environment and their basic emotional and physical needs must be consistently met. The following parenting suggestions may help.","A pediatric psychiatrist or psychologist can conduct a thorough, in-depth examination to diagnose reactive attachment disorder.

Your child's evaluation may include:

Your child's mental health provider will also want to rule out other psychiatric disorders and determine if any other mental health conditions coexist, such as:

Your child's mental health provider may use the diagnostic criteria for reactive attachment disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Diagnosis isn't usually made before 9 months of age. Signs and symptoms typically appear before the age of 5 years.

DSM-5 criteria for diagnosis include:","Children with reactive attachment disorder are believed to have the capacity to form attachments, but this ability has been hindered by their early developmental experiences.

Most children are naturally resilient. And even those who've been neglected, lived in a children's home or other institution, or had multiple caregivers can develop healthy relationships. Early intervention appears to improve outcomes.

There's no standard treatment for reactive attachment disorder, but it should involve both the child and parents or primary caregivers. Goals of treatment are to help ensure that the child:

A mental health professional can provide both education and coaching in skills that help improve signs and symptoms of reactive attachment disorder. Treatment strategies include:

Other services that may benefit the child and the family include:","If you're a parent or caregiver whose child has reactive attachment disorder, it's easy to become angry, frustrated, guilty and distressed. You may feel like your child doesn't love you — or that it's hard to like your child sometimes.

These actions may help:","You may start by visiting your child's pediatrician. However, you may be referred to a child psychiatrist or psychologist who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of reactive attachment disorder or a pediatrician specializing in child development.

Though it's called adultADHD, symptoms start in early childhood and continue into adulthood. In some cases,ADHDis not recognized or diagnosed until the person is an adult. AdultADHDsymptoms may not be as clear asADHDsymptoms in children. In adults, hyperactivity may decrease, but struggles with impulsiveness, restlessness and difficulty paying attention may continue.
Treatment for adultADHDis similar to treatment for childhoodADHD. AdultADHDtreatment includes medications, psychological counseling (psychotherapy) and treatment for any mental health conditions that occur along withADHD.","Some people withADHDhave fewer symptoms as they age, but some adults continue to have major symptoms that interfere with daily functioning. In adults, the main features ofADHDmay include difficulty paying attention, impulsiveness and restlessness. Symptoms can range from mild to severe.
Many adults withADHDaren't aware they have it — they just know that everyday tasks can be a challenge. Adults withADHDmay find it difficult to focus and prioritize, leading to missed deadlines and forgotten meetings or social plans. The inability to control impulses can range from impatience waiting in line or driving in traffic to mood swings and outbursts of anger.

Ear damage causes other types of hearing loss.
APDis also sometimes called central auditory processing disorder (CAPD). It can happen in anyone. But it most often happens in children and older adults.
Many conditions can affect how well a person understands what they hear, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism. But these conditions are different from auditory processing disorder, although they can appear withAPD.APDalso can happen with other types of hearing loss.
Auditory processing disorder has no cure. But treatments can help you hear better.","Symptoms of auditory processing disorder (APD) can be subtle. Symptoms can include having trouble with:
Telling where sound is coming from.
Understanding words that are spoken quickly or in a noisy room.
Paying attention.
Reading and spelling.
Following directions unless they are short and simple.
Learning a new language.
Singing or enjoying music.
Understanding and remembering spoken information.
If you haveAPD, you also might:
Take longer to reply to someone who is talking to you.
Often need others to repeat themselves.
Not understand sarcasm or jokes.
APDis often seen with attention, language and learning issues like those seen in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.","If you have trouble hearing or understanding what you hear, talk to a health care professional.","The cause of auditory processing disorder (APD) is sometimes unknown.APDcan be linked to many conditions. In older adults, conditions might include stroke and head trauma. In children,APDcan be linked to issues at birth, such as low birth weight or early birth, or repeated ear infections.
In typical hearing, the brain's auditory center takes the sound waves sent from the ears and turns them into sounds you know. But with auditory processing disorder (APD), the auditory part of the brain can't do this.","Factors that increase your risk of auditory processing disorder (APD) include:
Aging.
Stroke.
Head trauma.
Lead poisoning.
Seizure disorders.
Issues linked to birth, such as an early birth, low birth weight or a pregnant person using alcohol, drugs or tobacco.
Repeated ear infections, especially at a young age.","Auditory processing disorder (APD) complications include:
Trouble understanding what people are saying.
Trouble taking part in activities.
Feeling isolated and lonely.
Trouble reading and writing, in children.
Trouble doing well in school.
Feeling depressed.",,"To diagnose auditory processing disorder (APD), your health care team may ask questions about your symptoms and how long you have had them, as well as order tests.
Several specialists on your health care team might help diagnose you or your child with auditory processing disorder (APD). For children, the team might include teachers, who look at learning and attention issues. For children and adults, the team might include mental health professionals, called psychologists, who look at how the mind works. And speech-language pathologists can look at the use of language.
A hearing specialist called an audiologist may do tests to see what is happening when you or your child hear sounds. These tests might include:
Tympanometry.This test can tell if the eardrum isn't moving well. The eardrum needs to move for good hearing. For this test, the audiologist places a soft probe in the ear canal. Then they send small bits of air pressure toward the ear. The probe measures how much the eardrum moves in response to the air.
Acoustic reflex test.This test shows what happens in the ear when it hears a loud sound.
Auditory brainstem response.This test shows how well the inner ear, called the cochlea, and the brain pathways for hearing are working. An audiologist places sensors around the ear and on the head. The sensors connect to a computer.Short clicking sounds come through headphones worn during the test. The computer records how the nerves between the ears and the brain respond to the sounds.
Evoked potential test.This test shows how well sound travels along the nerves that connect the ears to the brain. For this test, an audiologist places sensors on the head. The sensors connect to a computer. Short clicking sounds come through headphones worn during the test.This lets an audiologist see how well sound gets to different parts of the brain. It also shows if anything is blocking the nerves that link the ears to the brain.","Not everyone with auditory processing disorder (APD) needs treatment. If you or your child need treatment, there are many approaches. Every person withAPDhas different needs. Your health care team can work with you to help you. Your or your child's treatment might include:
Hearing aids and listening devices.Your health care team may suggest that you use hearing aids with wireless listening devices. Listening devices help direct sound to you. They get sound from the source to your hearing aid.Frequency modulated, or FM, systems send sounds to you so you can hear them better. They work with a hearing aid and direct sounds to it. These systems help make it easier to hear sounds in noisy environments.
Auditory training.Auditory training,also called hearing rehabilitation, helps you adjust to hearing loss. You may train with an audiologist, a speech-language pathologist or both. You may train one-on-one with a therapist or as part of a group.During auditory training, you learn to tell one type of sound from another. You do this by listening to sounds that are louder and softer, given quickly and slowly. Sounds come from different directions. You also learn to tell the difference between speech sounds, which affects the meaning of the words you hear.Auditory training helps the brain tell the difference between the many sounds you hear every day. The goal is to help you feel like you're able to talk with others more.
Computer-based training.Computer-based programs can help train the brain to recognize and understand sounds. These programs are like auditory training, but you do them online or with a computer program.","Having auditory processing disorder (APD) can make you feel left out of everyday events. It can make you feel lonely. Auditory training as part of your treatment may help you or your child learn how to cope with hearing loss and adjust to it.
Auditory training might help you or your child learn to talk to others better and help them talk to you. This can help you feel less alone and more connected to others.","You or your child might start by seeing your family health care professional. For testing, you or your child might be referred to a specialist in hearing, called an audiologist.
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.","There are simple steps you can take to manage auditory processing disorder (APD). For instance:
Try using a remote microphone to improve how well you can hear in a noisy room.
Move closer to the person who is speaking.
Think about covering surfaces that make sounds echo, such as open or empty spaces.
Move away from other sources of noise, such as a fan.
In a class or at a meeting, ask someone to take notes for you or get a written copy of what was said.
Ask for anything important to be in writing.

Autoimmune epilepsy,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autoimmune-epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20576892,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autoimmune-epilepsy/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20576912,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autoimmune-epilepsy/doctors-departments/ddc-20576934,"Autoimmune epilepsy is a type of epilepsy where seizures are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking brain cells. It can occur with conditions that affect the immune system, especially autoimmune encephalitis.
Autoimmune epilepsy also is known as autoimmune associated epilepsy and acute symptomatic seizures secondary to autoimmune encephalitis.
The immune system protects the body from viruses, bacteria and other substances that can cause illnesses. Antibodies are proteins that are part of the immune system. In autoimmune epilepsy, antibodies mistakenly target receptors in the brain. This leads to swelling in the brain, also known as inflammation, and seizures.
Antiseizure medicines usually don't do enough to manage seizures in people with autoimmune epilepsy. Instead, immunotherapy medicines help reduce the immune response on the brain.
When immunotherapy is started early, it can reduce inflammation and improve seizures. For some people, treatment can stop seizures completely. For others, seizures may continue after treatment.","Symptoms of autoimmune epilepsy may begin after an illness with a fever. Seizures come on suddenly and are serious. The types of seizures that may occur include:
Focal seizures.These are the most common type of seizure in autoimmune epilepsy. Sometimes focal seizures cause a change or loss of awareness. The seizures may cause the person to stare and not respond to the environment. Other types of focal seizures don't cause a change in awareness. These seizures cause different symptoms depending on which part of the brain causes them. Focal seizures may cause one part of the body to shake. Or they may cause a feeling that his has happened before, known as déjà vu. Focal seizures also may cause nausea or vision symptoms, such as flashing lights.
Faciobrachial dystonic seizures.These seizures cause muscle contractions on one side of the face and in an arm, both on the same side of the body.
Symptoms related to seizures include:
Seizures that happen several times a day.
Seizures that don't go away with antiseizure medicines.
Seizures that last more than five minutes or that occur close together without the person regaining consciousness, known as status epilepticus.
Autoimmune epilepsy symptoms also may include:
Memory loss and trouble with thinking.
Personality and behavior changes.
Involuntary movements or clumsy movements.
Irregular eye movements.
Changes in heart rate, blood pressure and other automatic functions.","Get emergency medical care if you or someone you are with has a seizure that lasts more than five minutes or if seizures occur one after another with a loss of consciousness. Also seek emergency medical care for high fevers or trouble breathing.
See your healthcare professional right away if you have had a seizure for the first time or if you have other symptoms of autoimmune epilepsy.","Autoimmune epilepsy is caused by the immune system attacking brain cells and leading to seizures. Antibodies are part of the immune system. They usually protect the body from viruses and infections. But in autoimmune conditions, the immune system attacks healthy cells. More recently, research has concluded that epilepsy can be an autoimmune disease.
Autoimmune epilepsy causes may include:
Autoimmune encephalitis.Autoimmune encephalitis (en-sef-uh-LIE-tis) is a group of conditions that causes swelling in the brain. This happens because the immune system mistakenly attacks brain cells. Autoimmune encephalitis causes a variety of symptoms, including seizures. It is the most common cause of autoimmune epilepsy. Certain types of autoimmune encephalitis are commonly linked to autoimmune epilepsy and are associated with antibodies that target NMDA-receptors, LGI1, CASPR2 and GAD65.
Rasmussen syndrome.In this condition, immune cells known as T cells cause inflammation and brain damage that lead to seizures. People with autoimmune epilepsy due to Rasmussen syndrome may continue to have seizures after treatment.
Cancer.Sometimes tumors trigger the immune system to attack healthy brain cells, known as paraneoplastic syndrome. This can lead to epilepsy.","The risk of autoimmune epilepsy is low, but it can occur in both adults and children. Risk factors include:
Having another autoimmune disease. These may include rheumatoid arthritis, Graves' disease, Hashimoto thyroiditis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or lupus.
Having a history of cancer.
Having a parent, sibling or child with an autoimmune disease.","Autoimmune epilepsy complications can include serious seizures that last more than five minutes or occur one after another. The person isn't conscious in between the seizures. These serious seizures are known as status epilepticus. They need emergency medical attention.
Sometimes autoimmune epilepsy can lead to seizures that don't stop with treatment.","You may not be able to prevent autoimmune epilepsy. But getting cancer screenings can help your healthcare professional find tumors and treat them early. This could prevent autoimmune encephalitis triggered by cancers, which can be a cause of epilepsy. Talk with your healthcare professional about your cancer risk and if you should get screened for certain cancers.","An autoimmune epilepsy diagnosis begins with a physical exam and a review of your symptoms.
Testings for autoimmune epilepsy includes lab tests, brain imaging and testing the electrical activity in the brain.","Autoimmune epilepsy treatment differs from the treatment used for other types of epilepsy. Healthcare professionals use immunotherapy to reduce the immune system activity and treat seizures.
If cancer is the cause of autoimmune epilepsy, treating the cancer is an important part of treatment.",,"If your symptoms are serious, you might need emergency medical care.
If your symptoms are less serious, you may start by seeing your healthcare professional. Or you may be referred right away to a doctor who specializes in nervous system conditions, known as a neurologist.",
Autoimmune encephalitis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autoimmune-encephalitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20576380,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autoimmune-encephalitis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20576406,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autoimmune-encephalitis/doctors-departments/ddc-20576425,"Autoimmune encephalitis (en-sef-uh-LIE-tis) is a group of conditions that causes swelling in the brain. This happens because the immune system mistakenly attacks brain cells. Autoimmune encephalitis symptoms can vary but may include memory loss, changes in thinking, changes in behavior and seizures.
Autoimmune encephalitis is different from encephalitis caused by viral or bacterial infections, known as infectious encephalitis. Infectious encephalitis isn't caused by an immune reaction, and it's treated with different medicines. Research has found that the number of people with autoimmune encephalitis is comparable to the number of people with infectious encephalitis.
Experts don't know what causes autoimmune encephalitis, also known as AE. For some people, AE is triggered by certain cancers or infections. Autoimmune encephalitis also may be triggered by medicines. People with an autoimmune disease or a family history of autoimmune disease may be more likely to get AE. Healthcare professionals use several tests to diagnose autoimmune encephalitis.
Without treatment, autoimmune encephalitis can cause serious complications, including death. But treatments can lead to recovery. Many people with AE make a full recovery, but some can have lasting symptoms.","Autoimmune encephalitis symptoms can vary from person to person. But symptoms can occur in a pattern that is predictable depending on the type of autoimmune encephalitis. Many people have a headache, fever and other symptoms of an infection followed by:
Psychiatric symptoms that may include anxiety, panic attacks, changes in behavior, agitation, hallucinations, delusions and trouble organizing thoughts.
Trouble with memory.
Trouble with language, such as talking less or repeating words or phrases.
Movements that are not voluntary.
Seizures.
Changes in consciousness.
Less sleep at the beginning of the disease followed by excess sleep during recovery.
Sometimes AE causes serious seizures that need emergency care, known as status epilepticus. These seizures last more than five minutes or occur one after another while the person is not conscious.
Autoimmune encephalitis symptoms can get worse over time. This disease course is known as progressive. Symptoms also might alternate between getting better and getting worse. This course is known as relapsing-remitting. These are similar to the disease courses people experience with multiple sclerosis.","Get emergency medical care if you or someone you're with has serious symptoms of AE. This includes having seizures that last more than five minutes or that happen one after another with a loss of consciousness. Also seek emergency medical care for high fevers or trouble breathing.
See your healthcare professional right away if you have any other symptoms of autoimmune encephalitis. AE can become serious quickly if not treated.","Autoimmune encephalitis causes are not known. Autoimmune encephalitis, also known as AE, happens when the immune system mistakenly attacks heathy brain cells.
Antibodies are part of the immune system. They help protect the body from viruses, bacteria and other substances that can cause illnesses. But in autoimmune encephalitis, the antibodies target and attack certain receptors in the brain. This leads to swelling in the brain, also known as inflammation, and other symptoms.
AE may be triggered by:
Certain cancers. When this happens, it's known as paraneoplastic AE.
Infections, such as from the herpes simplex virus.
Certain medicines, such as monoclonal antibodies and medicines to suppress the immune system after a transplant.
Autoimmune encephalitis is more likely to occur in people who have an autoimmune disease or who have a strong family history of autoimmune disease.","Risk factors for autoimmune encephalitis, also known as AE, include:
Having had AE in the past, especially if it wasn't treated.
Having had herpes simplex virus encephalitis.
Taking monoclonal antibodies or medicines to suppress the immune system after a transplant.
Having a tumor, especially small-cell lung cancer.
Researchers are studying whether certain genes may be related to autoimmune encephalitis.","Serious autoimmune encephalitis, also known as AE, can lead to complications such as:
Seizures that need emergency care, known as status epilepticus.The immune system's attack on the brain during AE can lead to seizures and a condition called autoimmune epilepsy. Sometimes the seizures may last more than five minutes or occur one after another. The person isn't conscious in between the seizures. These serious seizures are known as status epilepticus.
Not enough air entering the lungs, known as respiratory failure.People with respiratory failure may need treatment with a machine that helps them breathe, known as mechanical ventilation.
Trouble with heart rate and blood pressure.AE can affect heart rate, blood pressure, digestion and urination. These are known as autonomic functions.
Fevers.People with AE may have high fevers.
Another possible complication is that the condition may come back after recovery. This is known as a relapse. A relapse is more likely in people who had anti-LGI1 limbic encephalitis or anti-CASPR2 associated encephalitis.","Autoimmune encephalitis, also known as AE, can't always be prevented. But getting cancer screenings can help your healthcare professional find tumors and treat them early. This could prevent autoimmune encephalitis that is triggered by cancers. Talk with your healthcare professional about your cancer risk and if cancer screening is recommended.","Autoimmune encephalitis diagnosis involves a review of your symptoms, a physical exam and several tests. It's important to get an accurate diagnosis because autoimmune encephalitis, also known as AE, can be mistaken for other diseases.
Experts have created autoimmune encephalitis criteria to help healthcare professionals diagnose people with AE. Healthcare professionals look for patterns of symptoms that signal AE. They also test for signs that antibodies are attacking receptors in the brain to cause AE.
Tests also help rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, such as infections or other autoimmune conditions.
Sometimes people are incorrectly diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis. It's important for healthcare professionals to consider all potential conditions when making a diagnosis.","Autoimmune encephalitis treatment focuses on the immune system, which is mistakenly attacking brain cells. If a tumor is causing autoimmune encephalitis, the first step is to diagnose and treat the tumor.",,"Autoimmune encephalitis can cause serious symptoms that need emergency medical care. Your healthcare team includes specialists, including doctors who specialize in the brain and nervous system, known as neurologists.
If your symptoms aren't as serious, you might start by seeing your regular healthcare professional. Your healthcare professional may refer you to a neurologist or another specialist. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.",
Bird flu (avian influenza),https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bird-flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20568390,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bird-flu/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20568430,,"Bird flu, also called avian influenza, is caused by influenza type A virus infections in bird species. Depending on the strain, bird flu may cause the bird to have no symptoms, mild illness, serious illness or lead to the death of the bird.
Bird flu rarely infects humans. But health officials worry because influenza A viruses that infect birds can change, called mutate, to infect humans and spread from person to person more often. Because a new strain of bird flu would be a new virus to humans, a mutated strain like that could spread quickly around the world.
People most often catch a bird flu virus from close, long-term contact with live, domesticated poultry typically on farms or in backyard coops. People also may catch bird flu through contact with wild birds or another type of animal. Bird flu rarely has spread from person to person.
In humans, flu is a viral infection of the nose, throat and lungs, which are part of the respiratory system. Symptoms of bird flu in humans are similar to flu symptoms and may be mild to serious.","Bird flu symptoms can be mild to serious in a person. Symptoms typically show up within seven days of contact with the virus but can take as long as two weeks. A person can get infected from direct contact with an infected animal, or the bedding or stool of the animal.
Flu viruses have similar symptoms. So you need to be tested to check if you have a bird flu infection.
Common bird flu symptoms include:
Fever.
Problems breathing.
Pink eye, also called conjunctivitis.
Upset stomach and vomiting.
Loose stool, called diarrhea.
Bird flu may cause breathing problems more often than other kinds of flu. And during bird flu pandemics, the risk that a person with flu will need a machine to help them breathe is higher.","If you have been exposed to bird flu and have any symptoms of illness, see a healthcare professional right away.
If your work, travel or hobbies may have exposed you to bird flu, consider your symptoms. If you have symptoms of bird flu and may have been exposed, contact your healthcare professional.","Influenza is caused by viruses that infect the cells that line the nose, throat and lungs.
Flu virus particles spread through breath, saliva, mucus or stool. Bird flu in humans can happen when you inhale virus particles. You also can catch the virus if you touch an object with flu particles on it, and then touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
People most often catch bird flu from close, long-term contact with live, domesticated poultry typically on farms or in backyard coops. Rarely, people are exposed to bird flu by contact with wild birds or another type of animal.
But birds you may see in a park or yard, such as crows or sparrows, aren't a high risk. They don't usually carry bird flu viruses that infect people or farm animals.
It may be possible to be exposed to bird flu through undercooked foods, such as eggs or poultry.  In places where bird flu has spread to dairy cows, it may be possible to get bird flu through raw dairy products. But dairy products that have been heated to kill germs, called pasteurization, are not a risk for bird flu.","The risk of a human catching a bird flu is low.
Contact with sick poultry or their environment is the most common bird flu risk for people. Infected birds can spread the virus through their breath, saliva, mucus or stool.
Rarely, people have caught bird flu after contact with wild birds or other animals. And sometimes humans have passed a bird flu to other humans.","People with bird flu may have worsening medical issues or new health problems. Some may be life-threatening.
Complications include:
Worsening of chronic lung conditions, such as asthma or cystic fibrosis.
Ear and sinus infection.
Failure of the respiratory system, called acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Kidney problems.
Heart problems.
Bleeding in the lungs, collapsed lung or bacterial pneumonia.
Sepsis.","To prevent bird flu, follow all recommended actions to protect yourself if you work with animals as a job.
If you are traveling to a place where bird flu is spreading, avoid poultry farms and bird markets if possible. Cook food fully and wash hands with soap and water after handling food and animals.
And make sure to get your seasonal flu vaccine every year. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone age 6 months or older. It doesn't prevent bird flu, but the seasonal flu vaccine can help you avoid having two flu viruses at the same time.
If a bird flu virus leads to a human pandemic, public health agencies have plans for vaccine development and administration.
People can take actions to further lower the risk of getting bird flu in many ways.
Avoid contact with animals who are sick or may be sick.Wild or domestic, keep birds at a distance to avoid any germs they may carry.
Wear eye, nose and mouth protective gear when needed.Flu viruses get in the body through the mouth, nose or eyes. Wear eye protection, a face mask and gloves to help keep the virus out if you're in an area where it might be present.
Wash your hands with soap and water.This is especially important after touching animals or surfaces that may be dirty with animal mucus, saliva or stool.
Getting bird flu from food is very rare. But it's a good idea to follow safe food handling recommendations.
Avoid spreading germs in the kitchen.Use hot, soapy water to wash all surfaces that have come into contact with raw poultry, meat, seafood or eggs.
Cook food fully.Cook chicken until it reaches an internal minimum temperature of 165 F (74 C). Cook eggs until the white and yolk are firm. Egg dishes, such as quiche, should reach 160 F (71 C). Cook beef to 145 F (63 C) and let it rest for 3 minutes. Cook ground beef to 160 F (71 C).
Avoid raw dairy products.Dairy milk that is heated to kill germs is called pasteurized. In the U.S., dairy milk and foods made with it say on the Nutrition Facts label if the milk is pasteurized. Raw milk isn't pasteurized, so it is more likely to make you sick.","To diagnose bird flu, a healthcare professional takes a sample of fluid from your nose and throat to test for evidence of bird flu infection. They also may take a sample of fluid from your eye if you have pink eye.
If you could have been exposed to bird flu through work, travel or your hobbies and you have symptoms of illness, see your healthcare professional right away.","Medicines that stop the flu virus from spreading in the body, called antivirals, work to treat bird flu. These medicines work best when started as soon as you have symptoms. For this reason, your healthcare professional may prescribe a medicine for you before your flu lab test results comes back.
These medicines can include oseltamivir (Tamiflu), zanamivir (Relenza) or peramivir (Rapivab).
Oseltamivir is taken by mouth. Zanamivir is inhaled using a device similar to an asthma inhaler. Peramivir is given through a needle in a vein.
If you have bird flu, stay in an area away from other people, including those you live with if possible. That will help prevent spreading the illness.
It's important to avoid people if you're waiting for lab results. If you do have bird flu, healthcare professionals may suggest testing for people who had close contact with you when you had symptoms. They may give antiviral medicine to people who were exposed to bird flu and are at high risk of serious illness.",,,
Avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis),https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/avascular-necrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20369859,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/avascular-necrosis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369863,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/avascular-necrosis/doctors-departments/ddc-20369864,"Avascular necrosis is the death of bone tissue due to a lack of blood supply. Also called osteonecrosis, it can lead to tiny breaks in the bone and cause the bone to collapse. The process usually takes months to years.

A broken bone or dislocated joint can stop the blood flow to a section of bone. Avascular necrosis is also associated with long-term use of high-dose steroid medications and too much alcohol.

Anyone can be affected. But the condition is most common in people between the ages of 30 and 50.","Some people have no symptoms in the early stages of avascular necrosis. As the condition worsens, affected joints might hurt only when putting weight on them. Eventually, you might feel the pain even when you're lying down.

Pain can be mild or severe. It usually develops gradually. Pain associated with avascular necrosis of the hip might center on the groin, thigh or buttock. Besides the hip, the shoulder, knee, hand and foot can be affected.

Some people develop avascular necrosis on both sides, such as in both hips or in both knees.",See your health care provider for ongoing pain in any joint. Seek immediate medical attention for a possible broken bone or dislocated joint.,"Avascular necrosis occurs when blood flow to a bone is interrupted or reduced. Reduced blood supply can be caused by:

Sometimes the cause of avascular necrosis not brought on by trauma isn't fully understood. Genetics combined with overuse of alcohol, certain medications and other diseases likely play a role.","Risk factors for developing avascular necrosis include:

Medical conditions associated with avascular necrosis include:","Untreated, avascular necrosis worsens. Eventually, the bone can collapse. Avascular necrosis also causes bone to lose its smooth shape, possibly leading to severe arthritis.",To reduce the risk of avascular necrosis and improve general health:,"During a physical exam, a health care provider will press around your joints, checking for tenderness. They might also move the joints through different positions to see if the range of motion is lessened.",The goal is to prevent further bone loss.,,Your health care provider might refer you to a doctor who specializes in disorders of the joints (rheumatologist) or to an orthopedic surgeon.,
Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT),https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/avnrt/symptoms-causes/syc-20573830,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/avnrt/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20573853,,"Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) is a type of irregular heartbeat, also called an arrhythmia. It is the most common type of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).
People with AVNRT have a very fast heartbeat that often starts and ends suddenly. In AVNRT, the heart beats more than 100 times a minute. The condition is due to a change in heart signaling.
AVNRT tends to occur more often in young women. But anyone can have it at any age. AVNRT may not need treatment. When treatment is needed, it may include specific actions or movements, medicines, or a heart procedure.","A very fast heartbeat is the most common symptom of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT). In AVNRT, the heart can beat between 120 to 280 times a minute. The fast heartbeat usually starts suddenly.
AVNRT does not always cause symptoms. When symptoms do show up, they may include:
A pounding feeling in the neck.
Pounding or fluttering heartbeat, called palpitations.
Chest pressure, tightness or pain.
Dizziness or lightheadedness.
Shortness of breath.
Sweating.
Weakness or extreme tiredness.
Fainting or almost fainting.
Symptoms of AVNRT may be mild in children. Some symptoms include sweating, trouble feeding, changes in skin color and a fast heartbeat.","Make an appointment for a healthcare checkup if you have unexplained changes in your heartbeat.
Also see a healthcare professional if an infant or child has these symptoms:
Fast heartbeat.
Sweating for no reason.
Changes in feeding.
Changes in skin color.
Call 911 or your local emergency number if you a very fast heartbeat that lasts for several minutes or happens with these symptoms:
Chest pain.
Dizziness.
Trouble breathing.
Weakness.","Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) is caused by faulty electrical signaling in the heart. Electrical signals control the heartbeat.
Usually, electrical signals in the heart follow a specific pathway. In AVNRT, there is an extra signaling pathway, called a reentrant circuit. The extra pathway makes the heart beat too early. This stops the heart from pumping blood like it should.
Healthcare professionals aren't sure why some people have the extra pathway that causes AVNRT. Sometimes, changes in the heart's structure may cause it.","Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) is more common in young women. But anyone can get it.
Some health conditions or treatments may increase the risk of AVNRT. These include:
Coronary artery disease, heart valve disease and other heart diseases.
Heart failure.
Heart condition present at birth, called a congenital heart defect.
Previous heart, lung or throat surgery.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
Thyroid disease.
Lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Diabetes that is not controlled.
Some medicines, including those used to treat asthma, allergies and colds.
Other things that may increase the risk of AVNRT include:
Emotional stress.
Caffeine.
Excessive alcohol use, which is defined as 15 or more drinks a week for men and eight or more drinks a week for women.
Smoking and using nicotine.
Stimulant drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine.","Possible complications of AVNRT are:
Worsening of existing heart disease.
Sudden stopping of all heart activity, called sudden cardiac arrest.",,"To diagnose atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT), a healthcare professional examines you and asks questions about your symptoms and medical history. The healthcare professional listens to your heart and lungs using a stethoscope.
Tests are often done to check heart health.","Most people with atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) don't need treatment. But if the fast heartbeat happens often or lasts a long time, treatment may be needed.
Treatment for AVNRT may include:
Vagal maneuvers.Simple but specific actions such as coughing, bearing down as if passing stool, gently massaging the main artery in the neck or putting an ice pack on the face can help slow down the heart rate. These actions affect the vagus nerve, which helps control the heartbeat.
Medicines.If the fast heartbeat happens frequently, your healthcare professional may prescribe medicines to slow or control your heart rate.
Cardioversion. Paddles or patches on the chest are used to electrically shock the heart and help reset the heart rhythm. Cardioversion is typically used when vagal maneuvers and medicines don't work.
Catheter ablation.This treatment may be suggested if medicines don't work or if their side effects are too bothersome. A doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube called a catheter through a blood vessel, usually in the groin, and guides it to the heart. Sensors on the tip of the catheter use heat or cold energy to create tiny scars in the heart. The scars block irregular electrical signals and restore a typical heartbeat.",,"If you have a very fast heartbeat that often starts and ends suddenly, make an appointment for a health checkup. If a fast heartbeat lasts more than a few minutes, get medical care right away.
You may see a doctor trained in heart conditions, called a cardiologist. You also might see a doctor trained in heart rhythm disorders, called an electrophysiologist.
Appointments can be short, so it's good to be prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready for your visit.",
