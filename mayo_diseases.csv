Atrial fibrillation,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350630,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/doctors-departments/ddc-20350632,"You may not know you have atrial fibrillation (AFib). The condition may be found when a health checkup is done for another reason.
To diagnoseAFib, the health care provider examines you and asks questions about your medical history and symptoms. Tests may be done to look for conditions that can cause irregular heartbeats, such as heart disease or thyroid disease.","The goals of atrial fibrillation treatment are to reset and control the heartbeat and prevent blood clots.
Treatment depends on:
How long you've hadAFib.
Your symptoms.
The cause of the irregular heartbeat.
Atrial fibrillation treatment may involve:
Medicine.
Therapy to reset the heart rhythm, called cardioversion.
Surgery or catheter procedures.
Together, you and your health care team discuss the best treatment option for you. It's important to follow your atrial fibrillation treatment plan. IfAFibisn't well controlled, it may lead to other complications, including stroke and heart failure.",,"If you have an irregular or pounding heartbeat, make an appointment for a health checkup. IfAFibis found early, treatment may be easier, and it may work better. You may be referred to a doctor trained in heart diseases. This type of provider is called a cardiologist.

You may also need a physical exam or tests to further evaluate the cause of your symptoms.,"Treating hyperhidrosis may start with treating the condition causing it. If a cause isn't found, treatment focuses on controlling heavy sweating. If new self-care habits don't improve your symptoms, your health care provider may suggest one or more of the following treatments. Even if your sweating improves after treatment, it may recur.","Hyperhidrosis can be the cause of discomfort and embarrassment. You may have trouble working or enjoying recreational activities because of wet hands or feet or wet stains on clothing. You might feel anxious about your symptoms and become withdrawn or self-conscious. You may be frustrated or upset by other people's reactions.
Talk about your concerns with your health care provider, a counselor or a medical social worker. Or you may find it helpful to talk with other people who have hyperhidrosis.","You may start by seeing your primary care provider. You may then be referred to a specialist in diagnosing and treating conditions of the hair and skin (dermatologist). If your condition is not responding to treatment, you may be referred to a specialist in the nervous system (neurologist) or a surgeon.

Bartholin's cyst,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bartholin-cyst/symptoms-causes/syc-20369976,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bartholin-cyst/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369981,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bartholin-cyst/doctors-departments/ddc-20369982,"To diagnose a Bartholin's cyst, your doctor may:

If cancer is a concern, your doctor may refer you to a gynecologist who specializes in cancers of the female reproductive system.","Often a Bartholin's cyst requires no treatment — especially if the cyst causes no signs or symptoms. When needed, treatment depends on the size of the cyst, your discomfort level and whether it's infected, which can result in an abscess.

Treatment options your doctor may recommend include:

Surgical drainage.You may need surgery to drain a cyst that's infected or very large. Drainage of a cyst can be done using local anesthesia or sedation.

For the procedure, your doctor makes a small incision in the cyst, allows it to drain, and then places a small rubber tube (catheter) in the incision. The catheter stays in place for up to six weeks to keep the incision open and allow complete drainage.

Rarely, for persistent cysts that aren't effectively treated by the above procedures, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the Bartholin's gland. Surgical removal is usually done in a hospital under general anesthesia. Surgical removal of the gland carries a greater risk of bleeding or complications after the procedure.",,Your first appointment will likely be with either your primary care provider or a doctor who specializes in conditions that affect women (gynecologist).
Infant reflux,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/infant-acid-reflux/symptoms-causes/syc-20351408,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/infant-acid-reflux/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351412,,"To diagnose infant reflux, a healthcare professional typically starts with a physical exam and asks questions about a baby's symptoms. If a baby is growing as expected and seems content, then testing usually isn't needed. In some cases, however, a healthcare professional might recommend:
Ultrasound.This imaging test can detect pyloric stenosis.
Lab tests.Blood and urine tests can help find or rule out possible causes of poor weight gain and vomiting that happens often.
Esophageal pH monitoring.To measure the acidity in a baby's esophagus, the health professional places a thin tube through the baby's nose or mouth and into the esophagus. The tube is attached to a device that monitors acidity. A baby might need to stay in the hospital while being monitored.
X-rays.These images can detect problems in the digestive tract, such as a blockage. A baby may be given a contrast liquid with a bottle before the test. This liquid is usually barium.
Upper endoscopy.An upper endoscopy uses a tiny camera on the end of a flexible tube called an endoscope to visually examine the upper digestive system. Tissue samples may be taken for analysis. For infants and children, endoscopy usually is done under general anesthesia. General anesthesia causes a sleeplike state before surgery or other medical procedures.","For most babies, making some changes to feeding eases infant reflux until it gets better on its own.",,"You may start by seeing your baby's primary healthcare team. Or you may be referred to a specialist in children's digestive diseases, called a pediatric gastroenterologist."

For many people, it takes years to receive a correct diagnosis.
Your health care provider will base a diagnosis on your signs and symptoms, skin appearance, and medical history. You might be referred to a health care provider who specializes in skin conditions, also known as a dermatologist. Hidradenitis suppurativa can be difficult to diagnose and requires specialized care.
No laboratory test is available to diagnose hidradenitis suppurativa. But if pus or drainage is present, your health care provider might take a sample for lab testing.","Treatment with medicines, surgery or both can help control symptoms and prevent complications of hidradenitis suppurativa. Talk with your health care provider about the risks and benefits of the treatment options and how to develop an approach that's right for you.
Expect to have regular follow-up visits with your dermatologist. Some people might need the comprehensive care provided by a health care team with members from multiple medical specialties.","Hidradenitis suppurativa can be a challenge to your emotional health and well-being. Painful sores might affect your sleep, ability to move or sex life. Or the sores might drain pus with an odor, which might make you feel anxious, embarrassed, angry, self-conscious or depressed. The ongoing, persistent nature of the disease and its treatment challenges add to the burden.
Try to find support among your family and friends. The concern and understanding of other people with hidradenitis suppurativa also might be comforting. Ask for help with your mental health and coping strategies. Your health care provider can refer you to a mental health professional or provide the contact information for a support group.","You'll likely first see your primary care provider. You might then be referred to a health care provider who specializes in diagnosing and treating skin diseases, also known as a dermatologist.

HIV/AIDS,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiv-aids/symptoms-causes/syc-20373524,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiv-aids/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20373531,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiv-aids/doctors-departments/ddc-20373532,"HIVcan be diagnosed through blood or saliva testing. Tests include:
Antigen-antibody tests.These tests most often use blood from a vein. Antigens are substances on theHIVvirus itself. They most often show up in the blood within a few weeks after being exposed toHIV.The immune system makes antibodies when it's exposed toHIV. It can take weeks to months for antibodies to show up in blood. You may not show a positive result on an antigen-antibody test until 2 to 6 weeks after exposure toHIV.
Antibody tests.These tests look for antibodies toHIVin blood or saliva. Most rapidHIVtests are antibody tests. This includes self-tests done at home. You may not show a positive result on an antibody test until 3 to 12 weeks after you've been exposed toHIV.
Nucleic acid tests (NATs).These tests look for the virus in your blood, called viral load. They use blood from a vein.If you might have been exposed toHIVwithin the past few weeks, your healthcare professional may suggestNAT.NATis the first test to become positive after exposure toHIV.
Talk with your healthcare professional about whichHIVtest is right for you. If any of these tests are negative, you may need a follow-up test weeks to months later to confirm the results.","There's no cure forHIV/AIDS. Once you have the infection, your body can't get rid of it. But there are medicines that can controlHIVand prevent complications.
Everyone diagnosed withHIVshould take antiretroviral therapy medicines, also called ART. This is true no matter what stage the disease is in or what the complications are.
ARTis usually a mix of two or more medicines from several classes. This approach has the best chance of lowering the amount ofHIVin the blood. There are manyARToptions that mix more than oneHIVmedicine into a single pill, taken once daily.
Each class of medicines blocks the virus in different ways. Treatment involves mixing medicines from different classes to:
Account for medicine resistance, called viral genotype.
Keep from creating new medicine-resistant strains ofHIV.
Suppress the virus in the blood as much as possible.
Two medicines from one class, plus a third medicine from another class, are most often used.
The classes of anti-HIVmedicines include the following:
Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)turn off a protein needed byHIVto make copies of itself.Examples include efavirenz, rilpivirine (Edurant) and doravirine (Pifeltro).
Nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)are faulty versions of the building blocks thatHIVneeds to make copies of itself.Examples include abacavir (Ziagen), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread), emtricitabine (Emtriva), lamivudine (Epivir) and zidovudine (Retrovir). Retrovir is no longer suggested for routine use in the U.S. because of high rates of toxic effects.Mixes of medicines also are available, such as emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) and emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Descovy).
Protease inhibitors (PIs)makeHIVprotease inactive.HIVprotease is another protein thatHIVneeds to make copies of itself.Examples include atazanavir (Reyataz), darunavir (Prezista) and lopinavir-ritonavir (Kaletra).
Integrase inhibitorsstop the action of a protein called integrase.HIVuses integrase to put its genetic material into CD4 T cells.Examples include bictegravir sodium-emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Biktarvy), raltegravir (Isentress), dolutegravir (Tivicay) and cabotegravir (Vocabria).
Entry or fusion inhibitorsblockHIV'sentry into CD4 T cells.Examples include enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) and maraviroc (Selzentry). Newer medicines include ibalizumab-uiyk (Trogarzo) and fostemsavir (Rukobia).","Getting a diagnosis of any life-threatening illness can cause distress. The emotional, social and financial effects ofHIV/AIDScan make coping with this illness very hard for you and for those close to you.
But there are many services and resources for people withHIV. MostHIV/AIDSclinics have social workers, counselors or nurses who can help you or put you in touch with people who can help you.
They may be able to:
Arrange transportation to and from medical appointments.
Help with housing and child care.
Assist with employment and legal issues.
Provide support during financial crises.
It's important to have a support system. Many people withHIV/AIDSfind that talking with someone who knows about their disease gives them comfort.","If you think you might have anHIVinfection, you're likely to start by seeing your family healthcare professional. You may be sent to an infectious disease specialist who focuses on treatingHIV/AIDS."
Acute myelogenous leukemia,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-myelogenous-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369109,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-myelogenous-leukemia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369115,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-myelogenous-leukemia/doctors-departments/ddc-20369117,"Acute myeloid leukemia diagnosis often begins with an exam that checks for bruising, bleeding in the mouth or gums, infection, and swollen lymph nodes. Other tests include blood and lab tests, bone marrow biopsy, lumbar puncture, and imaging.
Tests and exams to diagnose acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML, include:","Many types of treatment exist for acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML. Treatment depends on several factors, including the subtype of the disease, your age, your overall health, your prognosis and your preferences.
Treatment usually has two phases:
Remission induction therapy.This first phase aims to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow. But it doesn't usually destroy all the leukemia cells. You will need further treatment to keep the disease from coming back.
Consolidation therapy.This phase also is called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy. It aims to kill the remaining leukemia cells. Consolidation therapy is crucial to helping lower the risk of relapse.
Treatments include:
Chemotherapy.Chemotherapy treats cancer with strong medicines. Most chemotherapy medicines are given through a vein. Some come in pill form. Chemotherapy is the main type of remission induction therapy. It also may be used for consolidation therapy.
People with AML usually stay in the hospital during chemotherapy treatments because the medicines kill many healthy blood cells while destroying leukemia cells. If the first chemotherapy cycle doesn't cause remission, it can be repeated.
Side effects of chemotherapy depend on the medicines you're given. Common side effects are nausea and hair loss. Serious, long-term complications may include heart disease, lung damage, fertility problems and other cancers.
Targeted therapy.Targeted therapy for cancer is a treatment that uses medicines that attack specific chemicals in the cancer cells. By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy may be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy during induction therapy.
Bone marrow transplant.A bone marrow transplant, also called a bone marrow stem cell transplant, involves putting healthy bone marrow stem cells into the body. These cells replace cells hurt by chemotherapy and other treatments. A bone marrow stem cell transplant may be used for both remission induction and consolidation therapy.
Before a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor. This is called an allogeneic transplant.
There is an increased risk of infection after a transplant.
Clinical trials.Some people with leukemia choose to enroll in clinical trials to try experimental treatments or new combinations of known therapies.","Acute myelogenous leukemia is a fast-growing cancer that requires quick decision-making. The following tips and resources may help you cope:
Learn enough about acute myelogenous leukemia to make decisions about your care.The term leukemia can be confusing because it refers to a group of cancers that aren't all that alike except that they all affect the bone marrow and blood.You can waste a lot of time researching information that doesn't apply to your kind of leukemia. To avoid that, ask your doctor to write down as many details as possible about your specific disease. Then narrow your search to that disease.Look for information at your local library and on the internet. You can start your information search with the National Cancer Institute and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.
Lean on family, friends and others.Having a support system can help you cope. Get support from people close to you, a formal support group or others coping with cancer.
Take care of yourself.It's easy to get caught up in tests, treatments and procedures. But it's important to take care of yourself, not just the cancer. Try to make time for cooking, watching sports or other favorite activities. Get plenty of sleep, see friends, write in a journal and spend time outside if you can.
Stay active.Receiving a diagnosis of cancer doesn't mean you have to stop doing the things you enjoy. If you feel well enough to do something, do it. Check with your healthcare professional about starting any exercise program.","Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you have symptoms that worry you. You may be referred to a doctor who specializes in blood cell diseases. This type of doctor is called a hematologist.
Appointments can be brief, and there's a lot of information to discuss. It's a good idea to be prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready:"
Guillain-Barre syndrome,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362793,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20363006,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/doctors-departments/ddc-20363037,"Guillain-Barre syndrome can be hard to diagnose in its earliest stages. Its symptoms are similar to those of other conditions and may vary from person to person.
Your healthcare professional starts with a medical history and thorough physical exam.
Your healthcare professional may then recommend:
Spinal tap, also known as a lumbar puncture.A small amount of fluid is withdrawn from the spinal canal in your lower back. The fluid is tested for a type of change that commonly occurs in people who have Guillain-Barre syndrome.
Electromyography.Thin-needle electrodes are inserted into the muscles to measure nerve activity.
Nerve conduction studies.Electrodes are taped to the skin above your nerves. A small shock is passed through the nerve to measure the speed of nerve signals.","There's no cure for Guillain-Barre syndrome. But two types of treatments can speed recovery and reduce symptoms:
Plasma exchange, also known as plasmapheresis.Plasma is the liquid portion of part of your blood. In a plasma exchange, plasma is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then put back into your body, which makes more plasma to replace what was removed. Plasmapheresis may work by ridding plasma of certain antibodies that contribute to the immune system's attack on the peripheral nerves.
Immunoglobulin therapy.Immunoglobulin containing healthy antibodies from blood donors is given through a vein. High doses of immunoglobulin can block the damaging antibodies that may contribute to Guillain-Barre syndrome.
These treatments are equally effective. Mixing them or using one after the other is no more effective than using either method alone.
You are also likely to be given medicine to:
Relieve pain, which can be severe.
Prevent blood clots, which can develop if you're not mobile.
People with Guillain-Barre syndrome need physical help and therapy before and during recovery. Your care may include:
Movement of your arms and legs by caregivers before recovery, to help keep your muscles flexible and strong.
Physical therapy during recovery to help you cope with fatigue and regain strength and proper movement.
Training with adaptive devices, such as a wheelchair or braces, to give you mobility and self-care skills.","A diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome can be emotionally hard. Although most people eventually recover fully, the condition is generally painful and requires hospitalization and months of rehabilitation. People with Guillain-Barre syndrome must adjust to limited mobility and fatigue.
To manage the stress of recovery from Guillain-Barre syndrome, consider these suggestions:
Maintain a strong support system of friends and family.
Contact a support group, for yourself or for family members.
Discuss your feelings and concerns with a counselor.","You may be referred to a doctor who specializes in disorders of the brain and nervous system, known as a neurologist."

Blood tests.A sample of your blood may show fast-rising levels of urea and creatinine. This helps show how your kidneys are working.
Urine output measures.Measuring how much urine you pass in 24 hours may help find the cause of your kidney failure.
Urine tests.A sample of your urine may show something that suggests a condition that might explain kidney failure. This is called urinalysis.
Imaging tests.Imaging tests such as ultrasound and CT scans can show your kidneys.
Removing a sample of kidney tissue for testing.Your healthcare professional may suggest removing a small sample of your kidney tissue for lab testing. This is called a biopsy. A needle put through your skin and into your kidney removes the sample.",Treatment for acute kidney injury most often means a hospital stay. Most people with acute kidney injury are already in the hospital. How long you'll stay in the hospital depends on the reason for your acute kidney injury and how quickly your kidneys recover.,,"Most people are in a hospital when they get acute kidney injury. If you aren't in the hospital and have symptoms of kidney failure, make an appointment with your family healthcare professional right away. You may be referred to a specialist in kidney disease, called a nephrologist.
Before your appointment, write down questions. Consider asking:
What's the most likely cause of my symptoms?
Have my kidneys stopped working? What could have caused my kidney failure?
What tests do I need?
What are my treatment choices, and what are the risks?
Do I need to go to the hospital?
Will my kidneys recover or will I need dialysis?
I have other health conditions. How can I best manage these conditions together?
Do I need to eat a special diet? If so, can you refer me to a dietitian to help me plan what to eat?
Do you have printed materials about acute kidney injury that I can have? What websites do you suggest?"
Acute lymphocytic leukemia,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369077,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369083,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia/doctors-departments/ddc-20369085,"Tests and procedures used to diagnose acute lymphocytic leukemia include:
Blood tests.Blood tests may reveal too many or too few white blood cells, not enough red blood cells, and not enough platelets. A blood test may also show the presence of blast cells — immature cells normally found in the bone marrow.
Bone marrow test.During bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, a needle is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the hipbone or breastbone. The sample is sent to a lab for testing to look for leukemia cells.Doctors in the lab will classify blood cells into specific types based on their size, shape, and other genetic or molecular features. They also look for certain changes in the cancer cells and determine whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes. This information helps your doctor develop a treatment plan.
Imaging tests.Imaging tests such as an X-ray, a computerized tomography (CT) scan or an ultrasound scan may help determine whether cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord or other parts of the body.
Spinal fluid test.A lumbar puncture test, also called a spinal tap, may be used to collect a sample of spinal fluid — the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. The sample is tested to see whether cancer cells have spread to the spinal fluid.","In general, treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia falls into separate phases:
Induction therapy.The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill most of the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow and to restore normal blood cell production.
Consolidation therapy.Also called post-remission therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying any remaining leukemia in the body.
Maintenance therapy.The third phase of treatment prevents leukemia cells from regrowing. The treatments used in this stage are usually given at much lower doses over a long period of time, often years.
Preventive treatment to the spinal cord.During each phase of therapy, people with acute lymphocytic leukemia may receive additional treatment to kill leukemia cells located in the central nervous system. In this type of treatment, chemotherapy drugs are often injected directly into the fluid that covers the spinal cord.
Depending on your situation, the phases of treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia can span two to three years.
Treatments may include:
Chemotherapy.Chemotherapy, which uses drugs to kill cancer cells, is typically used as an induction therapy for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Chemotherapy drugs can also be used in the consolidation and maintenance phases.
Targeted therapy.Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy, consolidation therapy or maintenance therapy.
Radiation therapy.Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. If the cancer cells have spread to the central nervous system, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy.
Bone marrow transplant.A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be used as consolidation therapy or for treating relapse if it occurs. This procedure allows someone with leukemia to reestablish healthy bone marrow by replacing leukemic bone marrow with leukemia-free marrow from a healthy person.A bone marrow transplant begins with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation to destroy any leukemia-producing bone marrow. The marrow is then replaced by bone marrow from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).
Engineering immune cells to fight leukemia.A specialized treatment called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy takes your body's germ-fighting T cells, engineers them to fight cancer and infuses them back into your body.CAR-T cell therapy might be an option for children and young adults. It might be used for consolidation therapy or for treating relapse.
Clinical trials.Clinical trials are experiments to test new cancer treatments and new ways of using existing treatments. While clinical trials give you or your child a chance to try the latest cancer treatment, the benefits and risks of the treatment may be uncertain. Discuss the benefits and risks of clinical trials with your doctor.","Treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia can be a long road. Treatment often lasts two to three years, although the first months are the most intense.
During maintenance phases, children can usually live a relatively normal life and go back to school. And adults may be able to continue working. To help you cope, try to:
Learn enough about leukemia to feel comfortable making treatment decisions.Ask your doctor to write down as much information about your specific disease as possible. Then narrow your search for information accordingly.Write down questions you want to ask your doctor before each appointment, and look for information in your local library and on the internet. Good sources include the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.
Lean on your whole health care team.At major medical centers and pediatric cancer centers, your health care team may include psychologists, psychiatrists, recreation therapists, child-life workers, teachers, dietitians, chaplains and social workers. These professionals can help with a whole host of issues, including explaining procedures to children, finding financial assistance and arranging for housing during treatment. Don't hesitate to rely on their expertise.
Explore programs for children with cancer.Major medical centers and nonprofit groups offer numerous activities and services specifically for children with cancer and their families. Examples include summer camps, support groups for siblings and wish-granting programs. Ask your health care team about programs in your area.
Help family and friends understand your situation.Set up a free, personalized webpage at the nonprofit website CaringBridge. This allows you to tell the whole family about appointments, treatments, setbacks and reasons to celebrate — without the stress of calling everyone every time there's something new to report.","Make an appointment with your family doctor if you or your child has signs and symptoms that worry you.

Engineering immune cells to fight leukemia.A specialized treatment called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy takes your body's germ-fighting T cells, engineers them to fight cancer and infuses them back into your body.CAR-T cell therapy might be an option for children and young adults. It might be used for consolidation therapy or for treating relapse.
Clinical trials.Clinical trials are experiments to test new cancer treatments and new ways of using existing treatments. While clinical trials give you or your child a chance to try the latest cancer treatment, the benefits and risks of the treatment may be uncertain. Discuss the benefits and risks of clinical trials with your doctor.","Treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia can be a long road. Treatment often lasts two to three years, although the first months are the most intense.
During maintenance phases, children can usually live a relatively normal life and go back to school. And adults may be able to continue working. To help you cope, try to:
Learn enough about leukemia to feel comfortable making treatment decisions.Ask your doctor to write down as much information about your specific disease as possible. Then narrow your search for information accordingly.Write down questions you want to ask your doctor before each appointment, and look for information in your local library and on the internet. Good sources include the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.
Lean on your whole health care team.At major medical centers and pediatric cancer centers, your health care team may include psychologists, psychiatrists, recreation therapists, child-life workers, teachers, dietitians, chaplains and social workers. These professionals can help with a whole host of issues, including explaining procedures to children, finding financial assistance and arranging for housing during treatment. Don't hesitate to rely on their expertise.
Explore programs for children with cancer.Major medical centers and nonprofit groups offer numerous activities and services specifically for children with cancer and their families. Examples include summer camps, support groups for siblings and wish-granting programs. Ask your health care team about programs in your area.
Help family and friends understand your situation.Set up a free, personalized webpage at the nonprofit website CaringBridge. This allows you to tell the whole family about appointments, treatments, setbacks and reasons to celebrate — without the stress of calling everyone every time there's something new to report.","Make an appointment with your family doctor if you or your child has signs and symptoms that worry you. If your doctor suspects acute lymphocytic leukemia, you'll likely be referred to a doctor who specializes in treating diseases and conditions of the blood and bone marrow (hematologist).
Because appointments can be brief, and because there's often a lot of information to discuss, it's a good idea to be prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready, and what to expect from the doctor."

Other tests include blood and lab tests, bone marrow biopsy, lumbar puncture, and imaging.
Tests and exams to diagnose acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML, include:","Many types of treatment exist for acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML. Treatment depends on several factors, including the subtype of the disease, your age, your overall health, your prognosis and your preferences.
Treatment usually has two phases:
Remission induction therapy.This first phase aims to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow. But it doesn't usually destroy all the leukemia cells. You will need further treatment to keep the disease from coming back.
Consolidation therapy.This phase also is called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy. It aims to kill the remaining leukemia cells. Consolidation therapy is crucial to helping lower the risk of relapse.
Treatments include:
Chemotherapy.Chemotherapy treats cancer with strong medicines. Most chemotherapy medicines are given through a vein. Some come in pill form. Chemotherapy is the main type of remission induction therapy. It also may be used for consolidation therapy.
People with AML usually stay in the hospital during chemotherapy treatments because the medicines kill many healthy blood cells while destroying leukemia cells. If the first chemotherapy cycle doesn't cause remission, it can be repeated.
Side effects of chemotherapy depend on the medicines you're given. Common side effects are nausea and hair loss. Serious, long-term complications may include heart disease, lung damage, fertility problems and other cancers.
Targeted therapy.Targeted therapy for cancer is a treatment that uses medicines that attack specific chemicals in the cancer cells. By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy may be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy during induction therapy.
Bone marrow transplant.A bone marrow transplant, also called a bone marrow stem cell transplant, involves putting healthy bone marrow stem cells into the body. These cells replace cells hurt by chemotherapy and other treatments. A bone marrow stem cell transplant may be used for both remission induction and consolidation therapy.
Before a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor. This is called an allogeneic transplant.
There is an increased risk of infection after a transplant.
Clinical trials.Some people with leukemia choose to enroll in clinical trials to try experimental treatments or new combinations of known therapies.","Acute myelogenous leukemia is a fast-growing cancer that requires quick decision-making. The following tips and resources may help you cope:

This information is essential for determining how serious the illness is likely to be, which treatments to use and whether a person is likely to survive.
Information important for determining an absorbed dose includes:
Known exposure.Details about distance from the source of radiation and duration of exposure can help provide a rough estimate of the severity of radiation sickness.
Vomiting and other symptoms.The time between radiation exposure and when vomiting starts is a fairly accurate screening tool to estimate absorbed radiation dose. The shorter the time before vomiting starts, the higher the dose. The severity and timing of other symptoms also may help medical personnel determine the absorbed dose.
Blood tests.Frequent blood tests over several days enable medical personnel to look for drops in disease-fighting white blood cells and unusual changes in the DNA of blood cells. These factors indicate the degree of bone marrow damage, which is determined by the level of an absorbed dose.
Dosimeter.A device called a dosimeter can measure the absorbed dose of radiation but only if it was exposed to the same radiation event as the affected person.

Urine output measures.Measuring how much urine you pass in 24 hours may help find the cause of your kidney failure.
Urine tests.A sample of your urine may show something that suggests a condition that might explain kidney failure. This is called urinalysis.
Imaging tests.Imaging tests such as ultrasound and CT scans can show your kidneys.
Removing a sample of kidney tissue for testing.Your healthcare professional may suggest removing a small sample of your kidney tissue for lab testing. This is called a biopsy. A needle put through your skin and into your kidney removes the sample.",Treatment for acute kidney injury most often means a hospital stay. Most people with acute kidney injury are already in the hospital. How long you'll stay in the hospital depends on the reason for your acute kidney injury and how quickly your kidneys recover.,,"Most people are in a hospital when they get acute kidney injury. If you aren't in the hospital and have symptoms of kidney failure, make an appointment with your family healthcare professional right away.

If your provider suspects that you have a problem with alcohol, you may be referred to a mental health provider.
To assess your problem with alcohol, your provider will likely:
Ask you some questions related to your drinking habits.The provider may ask for permission to speak with family members or friends. However, confidentiality laws prevent your provider from giving out any information about you without your consent.
Perform a physical exam.Your health care provider may do a physical exam and ask questions about your health. There are many physical signs that indicate complications of alcohol use.
Suggest lab tests and imaging tests.While there are no specific tests to diagnose alcohol use disorder, certain patterns of lab test results may strongly suggest it. And you may need tests to identify health problems that may be linked to your alcohol use. Damage to your organs may be seen on tests.
Complete a psychological evaluation.This evaluation includes questions about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may be asked to complete a questionnaire to help answer these questions.","Treatment for alcohol use disorder can vary, depending on your needs. Treatment may involve a brief intervention, individual or group counseling, an outpatient program, or a residential inpatient stay. Working to stop alcohol use to improve quality of life is the main treatment goal.
Treatment for alcohol use disorder may include:
Detox and withdrawal.Treatment may begin with a program of detoxification — withdrawal that's medically managed. Sometimes called detox, this generally takes 2 to 7 days. You may need to take sedating medications to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Detox is usually done at an inpatient treatment center or a hospital.
Learning new skills and making a treatment plan.This process usually involves alcohol treatment specialists. It may include goal setting, behavior change techniques, use of self-help manuals, counseling and follow-up care at a treatment center.
Psychological counseling.Counseling and therapy for groups and individuals help you better understand your problem with alcohol and support recovery from the psychological aspects of alcohol use. You may benefit from couples or family therapy — family support can be an important part of the recovery process.
Oral medications.A drug called disulfiram may help prevent you from drinking, although it won't cure alcohol use disorder or remove the urge to drink. If you drink alcohol while taking disulfiram, the drug produces a physical reaction that may include flushing, nausea, vomiting and headaches.Naltrexone, a drug that blocks the good feelings alcohol causes, may prevent heavy drinking and reduce the urge to drink. Acamprosate may help you combat alcohol cravings once you stop drinking. Unlike disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate don't make you feel sick after taking a drink.
Injected medication.Vivitrol, a version of the drug naltrexone, is injected once a month by a health care professional. Although similar medication can be taken in pill form, the injectable version of the drug may be easier for people recovering from alcohol use disorder to use consistently.
Continuing support.Aftercare programs and support groups help people recovering from alcohol use disorder to stop drinking, manage relapses and cope with necessary lifestyle changes. This may include medical or psychological care or attending a support group.
Treatment for psychological problems.Alcohol use disorder commonly occurs along with other mental health disorders. If you have depression, anxiety or another mental health condition, you may need talk therapy (psychotherapy), medications or other treatment.
Medical treatment for health conditions.Many alcohol-related health problems improve significantly once you stop drinking. But some health conditions may warrant continued treatment and follow-up care.
Spiritual practice.People who are involved with some type of regular spiritual practice may find it easier to maintain recovery from alcohol use disorder or other addictions. For many people, gaining greater insight into their spiritual side is a key element in recovery.","Many people with alcohol problems and their family members find that participating in support groups is an essential part of coping with the disease, preventing or dealing with relapses, and staying sober. Your health care provider or counselor can suggest a support group. These groups are also often listed on the web.
Here are a few examples:
Alcoholics Anonymous.Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a self-help group for people recovering from alcoholism. AA offers a sober peer group and is built around 12 steps as an effective model for achieving total abstinence.
Women for Sobriety.Women for Sobriety is a nonprofit organization offering a self-help group program for women who want to overcome alcoholism and other addictions. It focuses on developing coping skills related to emotional and spiritual growth, self-esteem, and a healthy lifestyle.
Al-Anon and Alateen.Al-Anon is designed for people who are affected by someone else's alcoholism. Alateen groups are available for teenage children of those with alcoholism. In sharing their stories, family members gain a greater understanding of how the disease affects the entire family.
Celebrate Recovery.Celebrate Recovery is a Christ-centered, 12-step recovery program for people struggling with addiction.
SMART Recovery.SMART Recovery offers mutual support meetings for people seeking science-based, self-empowered addiction recovery.","Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment, and what to expect from your health care provider or mental health provider.
Consider your drinking habits. Take an honest look at how often and how much you drink. Be prepared to discuss any problems that alcohol may be causing. You may want to take a family member or friend along, if possible.
Before your appointment, make a list of:
Any symptoms you've had,including any that may seem unrelated to your drinking
Key personal information,including any major stresses or recent life changes
All medications,vitamins, herbs or other supplements that you're taking and their dosages
Questions to askyour provider
Some questions to ask include:
Do you think I drink too much or show signs of problem drinking?
Do you think I need to cut back or quit drinking?
Do you think alcohol could be causing or worsening my other health problems?
What's the best course of action?
What are the alternatives to the approach that you're suggesting?
Do I need any medical tests for underlying physical problems?
Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can have? What websites do you recommend?
Would it be helpful for me to meet with a professional experienced in alcohol treatment?
Don't hesitate to ask any other questions."

Join a support group.Support groups for people with schizophrenia can help you reach out to other families facing similar challenges. You may want to seek out separate groups for you and for your child so that you each have a safe outlet.
Get professional help.If you as a parent or guardian feel overwhelmed and distressed by your child's condition, consider seeking help for yourself from a mental health professional.
Stay focused on goals.Dealing with childhood schizophrenia is an ongoing process. Stay motivated as a family by keeping treatment goals in mind.
Find healthy outlets.Explore healthy ways your whole family can channel energy or frustration, such as hobbies, exercise and recreational activities.
Make healthy lifestyle choices.Maintaining a regular schedule that includes sufficient sleep, healthy eating and regular physical activity is important to mental health.
Take time as individuals.Although managing childhood schizophrenia is a family affair, both children and parents need their own time to cope and unwind. Create opportunities for healthy alone time.

Its symptoms are similar to those of other conditions and may vary from person to person.
Your healthcare professional starts with a medical history and thorough physical exam.
Your healthcare professional may then recommend:
Spinal tap, also known as a lumbar puncture.A small amount of fluid is withdrawn from the spinal canal in your lower back. The fluid is tested for a type of change that commonly occurs in people who have Guillain-Barre syndrome.
Electromyography.Thin-needle electrodes are inserted into the muscles to measure nerve activity.
Nerve conduction studies.Electrodes are taped to the skin above your nerves. A small shock is passed through the nerve to measure the speed of nerve signals.","There's no cure for Guillain-Barre syndrome. But two types of treatments can speed recovery and reduce symptoms:
Plasma exchange, also known as plasmapheresis.Plasma is the liquid portion of part of your blood. In a plasma exchange, plasma is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then put back into your body, which makes more plasma to replace what was removed. Plasmapheresis may work by ridding plasma of certain antibodies that contribute to the immune system's attack on the peripheral nerves.
Immunoglobulin therapy.Immunoglobulin containing healthy antibodies from blood donors is given through a vein. High doses of immunoglobulin can block the damaging antibodies that may contribute to Guillain-Barre syndrome.
These treatments are equally effective. Mixing them or using one after the other is no more effective than using either method alone.
You are also likely to be given medicine to:
Relieve pain, which can be severe.
Prevent blood clots, which can develop if you're not mobile.
People with Guillain-Barre syndrome need physical help and therapy before and during recovery. Your care may include:
Movement of your arms and legs by caregivers before recovery, to help keep your muscles flexible and strong.
Physical therapy during recovery to help you cope with fatigue and regain strength and proper movement.
Training with adaptive devices, such as a wheelchair or braces, to give you mobility and self-care skills.","A diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome can be emotionally hard. Although most people eventually recover fully, the condition is generally painful and requires hospitalization and months of rehabilitation. People with Guillain-Barre syndrome must adjust to limited mobility and fatigue.
To manage the stress of recovery from Guillain-Barre syndrome, consider these suggestions:
Maintain a strong support system of friends and family.
Contact a support group, for yourself or for family members.

Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)turn off a protein needed byHIVto make copies of itself.Examples include efavirenz, rilpivirine (Edurant) and doravirine (Pifeltro).
Nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)are faulty versions of the building blocks thatHIVneeds to make copies of itself.Examples include abacavir (Ziagen), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread), emtricitabine (Emtriva), lamivudine (Epivir) and zidovudine (Retrovir). Retrovir is no longer suggested for routine use in the U.S. because of high rates of toxic effects.Mixes of medicines also are available, such as emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) and emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Descovy).
Protease inhibitors (PIs)makeHIVprotease inactive.HIVprotease is another protein thatHIVneeds to make copies of itself.Examples include atazanavir (Reyataz), darunavir (Prezista) and lopinavir-ritonavir (Kaletra).
Integrase inhibitorsstop the action of a protein called integrase.HIVuses integrase to put its genetic material into CD4 T cells.Examples include bictegravir sodium-emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Biktarvy), raltegravir (Isentress), dolutegravir (Tivicay) and cabotegravir (Vocabria).
Entry or fusion inhibitorsblockHIV'sentry into CD4 T cells.Examples include enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) and maraviroc (Selzentry). Newer medicines include ibalizumab-uiyk (Trogarzo) and fostemsavir (Rukobia).","Getting a diagnosis of any life-threatening illness can cause distress. The emotional, social and financial effects ofHIV/AIDScan make coping with this illness very hard for you and for those close to you.
But there are many services and resources for people withHIV. MostHIV/AIDSclinics have social workers, counselors or nurses who can help you or put you in touch with people who can help you.
They may be able to:
Arrange transportation to and from medical appointments.
Help with housing and child care.
Assist with employment and legal issues.
Provide support during financial crises.
It's important to have a support system. Many people withHIV/AIDSfind that talking with someone who knows about their disease gives them comfort.","If you think you might have anHIVinfection, you're likely to start by seeing your family healthcare professional. You may be sent to an infectious disease specialist who focuses on treatingHIV/AIDS."
Alcohol use disorder,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-use-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20369243,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-use-disorder/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369250,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-use-disorder/doctors-departments/ddc-20369252,"You're likely to start by seeing your primary health care provider. If your provider suspects that you have a problem with alcohol, you may be referred to a mental health provider.
To assess your problem with alcohol, your provider will likely:
Ask you some questions related to your drinking habits.The provider may ask for permission to speak with family members or friends. However, confidentiality laws prevent your provider from giving out any information about you without your consent.
Perform a physical exam.Your health care provider may do a physical exam and ask questions about your health. There are many physical signs that indicate complications of alcohol use.
Suggest lab tests and imaging tests.While there are no specific tests to diagnose alcohol use disorder, certain patterns of lab test results may strongly suggest it. And you may need tests to identify health problems that may be linked to your alcohol use. Damage to your organs may be seen on tests.
Complete a psychological evaluation.This evaluation includes questions about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may be asked to complete a questionnaire to help answer these questions.","Treatment for alcohol use disorder can vary, depending on your needs. Treatment may involve a brief intervention, individual or group counseling, an outpatient program, or a residential inpatient stay. Working to stop alcohol use to improve quality of life is the main treatment goal.
Treatment for alcohol use disorder may include:
Detox and withdrawal.Treatment may begin with a program of detoxification — withdrawal that's medically managed. Sometimes called detox, this generally takes 2 to 7 days. You may need to take sedating medications to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Detox is usually done at an inpatient treatment center or a hospital.
Learning new skills and making a treatment plan.This process usually involves alcohol treatment specialists. It may include goal setting, behavior change techniques, use of self-help manuals, counseling and follow-up care at a treatment center.
Psychological counseling.Counseling and therapy for groups and individuals help you better understand your problem with alcohol and support recovery from the psychological aspects of alcohol use. You may benefit from couples or family therapy — family support can be an important part of the recovery process.
Oral medications.A drug called disulfiram may help prevent you from drinking, although it won't cure alcohol use disorder or remove the urge to drink. If you drink alcohol while taking disulfiram, the drug produces a physical reaction that may include flushing, nausea, vomiting and headaches.Naltrexone, a drug that blocks the good feelings alcohol causes, may prevent heavy drinking and reduce the urge to drink. Acamprosate may help you combat alcohol cravings once you stop drinking. Unlike disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate don't make you feel sick after taking a drink.
Injected medication.Vivitrol, a version of the drug naltrexone, is injected once a month by a health care professional. Although similar medication can be taken in pill form, the injectable version of the drug may be easier for people recovering from alcohol use disorder to use consistently.
Continuing support.Aftercare programs and support groups help people recovering from alcohol use disorder to stop drinking, manage relapses and cope with necessary lifestyle changes. This may include medical or psychological care or attending a support group.
Treatment for psychological problems.Alcohol use disorder commonly occurs along with other mental health disorders. If you have depression, anxiety or another mental health condition, you may need talk therapy (psychotherapy), medications or other treatment.
Medical treatment for health conditions.Many alcohol-related health problems improve significantly once you stop drinking. But some health conditions may warrant continued treatment and follow-up care.
Spiritual practice.People who are involved with some type of regular spiritual practice may find it easier to maintain recovery from alcohol use disorder or other addictions. For many people, gaining greater insight into their spiritual side is a key element in recovery.","Many people with alcohol problems and their family members find that participating in support groups is an essential part of coping with the disease, preventing or dealing with relapses, and staying sober. Your health care provider or counselor can suggest a support group. These groups are also often listed on the web.
Here are a few examples:
Alcoholics Anonymous.Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a self-help group for people recovering from alcoholism. AA offers a sober peer group and is built around 12 steps as an effective model for achieving total abstinence.
Women for Sobriety.Women for Sobriety is a nonprofit organization offering a self-help group program for women who want to overcome alcoholism and other addictions. It focuses on developing coping skills related to emotional and spiritual growth, self-esteem, and a healthy lifestyle.
Al-Anon and Alateen.Al-Anon is designed for people who are affected by someone else's alcoholism. Alateen groups are available for teenage children of those with alcoholism. In sharing their stories, family members gain a greater understanding of how the disease affects the entire family.
Celebrate Recovery.Celebrate Recovery is a Christ-centered, 12-step recovery program for people struggling with addiction.
SMART Recovery.SMART Recovery offers mutual support meetings for people seeking science-based, self-empowered addiction recovery.","Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment, and what to expect from your health care provider or mental health provider.

One or both of these tests may be recommended:
Skin prick test.Small amounts of material that can trigger allergies are pricked into patches of skin on the arm or upper back. A medical professional then watches the skin for an allergic reaction. If someone has an allergy, a raised bump called a hive forms at the site of that allergen. This typically takes about 15 to 20 minutes. Allergy specialists usually are best equipped to perform allergy skin tests.
Allergy blood test.A blood sample is sent to a lab to measure the immune system's response to a specific allergen. This test measures the amount of allergy-causing antibodies in the bloodstream, known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies.","Once someone knows their allergy triggers, a healthcare professional can help develop a treatment plan to reduce or get rid of hay fever symptoms.
It's best to limit exposure to substances that cause hay fever. If hay fever isn't too severe, nonprescription medicines may be enough to relieve symptoms. For worse symptoms, prescription medicines may be needed.
Many people get the best relief from a combination of allergy medicines. Sometimes, a few different options need to be tried before finding what works best.
If a child has hay fever, talk with the child's healthcare professional about treatment. Not all medicines are approved for use in children. Read labels carefully.
Treatments for hay fever may include medicines, immunotherapy and nasal saline rinses.",,"You're likely to start by seeing your primary healthcare professional. However, in some cases when you call to set up an appointment, you may be referred to an allergist or other specialist.

Dust mite allergy,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dust-mites/symptoms-causes/syc-20352173,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dust-mites/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352178,,"Your doctor may suspect dust mite allergy based on symptoms and your answers to questions about your home.

To confirm that you're allergic to some airborne substance, your doctor may use a lighted instrument to look at the condition of the lining of your nose. If you have an allergy to something airborne, the lining of the nasal passage will be swollen and may appear pale or bluish.

Your doctor may suspect a dust mite allergy if your symptoms are worse when you go to bed or while cleaning — when dust mite allergens would be temporarily airborne. If you have a pet, it may be more difficult to determine the cause of the allergy, particularly if your pet sleeps in your bedroom.

Allergy skin test.Your doctor may suggest an allergy skin test to determine what you're allergic to. You may be referred to an allergy specialist (allergist) for this test.

In this test, tiny amounts of purified allergen extracts — including an extract for dust mites — are pricked onto your skin's surface. This is usually carried out on the forearm, but it may be done on the upper back.

Your doctor or nurse observes your skin for signs of allergic reactions after 15 minutes. If you're allergic to dust mites, you'll develop a red, itchy bump where the dust mite extract was pricked onto your skin. The most common side effects of these skin tests are itching and redness. These side effects usually go away within 30 minutes.","The first treatment for controlling dust mite allergy is avoiding dust mites as much as possible. When you minimize your exposure to dust mites, you can expect fewer or less severe allergic reactions. However, it's impossible to completely eliminate dust mites from your environment. You may also need medications to control symptoms.",,"If you have what seems like a constant runny nose, sneezing, wheezing, shortness of breath or other symptoms that may be related to an allergy, you'll probably start by seeing your family doctor or general practitioner. Because appointments can be brief and there's often a lot of ground to cover, it's a good idea to prepare before you go."

In many cases, what seems to be egg allergy is actually caused by food intolerance, which is generally less serious than food allergy and doesn't involve the immune system.

Your doctor takes a medical history and conducts a physical exam. He or she may also recommend one or more of the following tests:","The only way to prevent egg allergy symptoms is to avoid eggs or egg products. Some people with egg allergies, however, can tolerate foods that contain well-cooked eggs, such as baked goods.",,You'll likely begin by seeing your family doctor or pediatrician.

Your healthcare team will consider a few factors before making a diagnosis. These factors include:
Your symptoms.Give your care team a detailed history of your or your child's symptoms — which foods, and how much, seem to cause problems.
Your family history of allergies.Also share information about members of your family who have allergies of any kind.
A physical examination.A careful exam can often identify or exclude other medical problems.
A skin test.A skin prick test can determine whether you may react to a particular food. In this test, a small amount of the suspected food is placed on the skin of your forearm or back. A doctor or another healthcare professional then pricks your skin to allow a tiny amount of the substance beneath your skin surface.If you're allergic to a particular substance being tested, you develop a raised bump or reaction. However, a positive reaction to this test alone isn't enough to confirm a food allergy.
A blood test.A blood test can measure your immune system's response to particular foods by measuring the allergy-related antibody known as immunoglobulin E (IgE).For this test, a blood sample taken in your care professional's office is sent to a medical laboratory. It will then be tested for foods that could have caused an allergic reaction.
Elimination diet.You may be asked to eliminate suspect foods for a week or two and then add the food items back into your diet one at a time. This process can help link symptoms to specific foods. However, elimination diets aren't foolproof.An elimination diet can't tell you whether your reaction to a food is a true allergy instead of a food sensitivity. Also, if you've had a severe reaction to a food in the past, an elimination diet may not be safe.
Oral food challenge.During this test, done in a healthcare professional's office, you'll be given small but increasing amounts of the food suspected of causing your symptoms. If you don't have a reaction during this test, you may be able to include this food in your diet again.","One way to avoid an allergic reaction is to avoid the foods that cause symptoms. However, despite your best efforts, you may come into contact with a food that causes a reaction.
For a minor allergic reaction,prescribed antihistamines or those available without a prescription may help reduce symptoms. These drugs can be taken after exposure to an allergy-causing food to help relieve itching or hives. However, antihistamines can't treat a severe allergic reaction.
For a severe allergic reaction,you may need an emergency injection of epinephrine and a trip to the emergency room. Many people with allergies carry an epinephrine autoinjector (Adrenaclick, EpiPen). This device is a combined syringe and concealed needle that injects a single dose of medicine when pressed against your thigh.
If you've been prescribed an epinephrine autoinjector:
Be sure you know how to use the autoinjector.Also, make sure the people closest to you know how to give the drug — if they're with you in an anaphylactic emergency, they could save your life.
Carry it with you at all times.It may be a good idea to keep an extra autoinjector in your car or in your desk at work.
Always be sure to replace epinephrine before its expiration dateor it may not work properly.","A food allergy can be a source of ongoing concern that affects life at home, school and work. Daily activities that are easy for most families, such as grocery shopping and meal preparation, can become occasions of stress for families and caregivers living with food allergies.
Keep these strategies in mind to help manage your or your child's food allergy-related stress:
Connect with others.The opportunity to discuss food allergies and exchange information with others who share your concerns can be very helpful.Many internet sites and nonprofit organizations offer information and forums for discussing food allergies. Some are specifically for parents of children with food allergies. The Food Allergy Research & Education website can direct you to support groups and events in your area.
Educate those around you.Make sure family and caregivers, including babysitters and school staff, have a thorough understanding of your child's food allergy.
Address bullying.Children are sometimes bullied at school because of their food allergies. Discussing your child's allergy with school personnel greatly reduces your child's risk of being a bullying target.","Because appointments can be brief, and because there's often a lot of ground to cover, it's a good idea to be well prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready and what to expect.
Write down any symptoms you've had,including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.
Write down key personal information,including any major stresses or recent life changes.
Make a list of all medicines,vitamins and supplements that you're taking.
Take a family member or friend along,if possible. Sometimes it can be difficult to remember all the information provided to you during an appointment. Someone who accompanies you may recall something that you missed or forgot.
Write down questions to askyour care team.
Your time is limited, so preparing a list of questions will help you make the most of your time together. List your questions from most important to least important in case time runs out. Some basic questions to ask include:

If your examination and test results can't confirm milk allergy, your health care provider might administer an oral challenge, in which you are fed different foods that may or may not contain milk in increasing amounts to see if you react to the ones that contain milk. It's a good idea to have allergy tests administered by an allergist who's been trained to manage serious reactions.

If your provider suspects that your symptoms are caused by something other than a food allergy, you may need other tests to identify — or rule out — other medical problems.","The only way to prevent an allergic reaction is to avoid milk and milk proteins. This can be difficult because milk is a common ingredient in many foods. Also, some people with milk allergy can tolerate milk in some forms, such as milk that's heated in baked goods, or in some processed foods, such as yogurt. Talk to your health care provider about what to avoid.

If you or your child has a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), you may need an emergency injection of epinephrine (adrenaline) and a trip to the emergency room. If you're at risk of having a severe reaction, you or your child may need to carry injectable epinephrine (EpiPen, Adrenaclick, others) at all times. Have your provider or pharmacist demonstrate how to use this device so that you're prepared for an emergency.","Having a serious allergy or being the parent of a child with a potentially life-threatening allergy can be stressful. Talking to others in similar situations can be helpful. Besides offering support and encouragement, they may also provide useful coping tips, such as how to deal effectively with school officials to ensure your child's medical needs are met.

Mold allergy,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mold-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20351519,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mold-allergy/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351525,,"Besides considering your signs and symptoms, your doctor might conduct a physical examination to identify or exclude other medical problems. Tests used to identify an allergy include:","The best way to manage an allergy is to avoid exposure to triggers. However, molds are common, and you can't completely avoid them.

While there's no sure way to cure allergic rhinitis caused by a mold allergy, a number of medications can ease your symptoms. These include:

Nasal corticosteroids.These nasal sprays help prevent and treat the inflammation caused by an upper respiratory mold allergy. For many people, they're the most effective allergy medications, and they're often the first medication prescribed.

Examples include ciclesonide (Omnaris, Zetonna), fluticasone (Flonase Allergy Relief, Xhance), mometasone (Nasonex), triamcinolone and budesonide (Rhinocort). Nosebleeds and nasal dryness are the most common side effects of these medications, which are generally safe for long-term use.

Antihistamines.These medications can help with itching, sneezing and runny nose. They work by blocking histamine, an inflammatory chemical released by your immune system during an allergic reaction.

Over-the-counter (OTC) antihistamines include loratadine (Alavert, Claritin), fexofenadine (Allegra Allergy) and cetirizine (Zyrtec Allergy). They cause little to no drowsiness or dry mouth.

The nasal sprays azelastine (Astelin, Astepro) and olopatadine (Patanase) are available by prescription. Side effects of the nasal sprays can include a bitter taste in your mouth and nasal dryness.

Montelukast.Montelukast (Singulair) is a tablet taken to block the action of leukotrienes — immune system chemicals that cause allergy symptoms such as excess mucus. However, concerns about side effects, including anxiety, insomnia, depression and suicidal thinking, are increasing. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently put a warning on the box about the drug's use.

Like antihistamines, this medication is not as effective as inhaled corticosteroids. It has been used when nasal sprays cannot be tolerated or when mild asthma is present.

Other treatments for mold allergy include:

Nasal lavage.To help with irritating nasal symptoms, your doctor might recommend that you rinse your nose daily with salt water. Use a specially designed squeeze bottle, such as the one included in saline kits (Sinus Rinse, others), bulb syringe or neti pot to irrigate your nasal passages. This home remedy, called nasal lavage, can help keep your nose free of irritants.

Use water that's distilled, sterile, previously boiled and cooled, or filtered using a filter with an absolute pore size of 1 micron or smaller to make up the irrigation solution. Be sure to rinse the irrigation device after each use with similarly distilled, sterile, previously boiled and cooled, or filtered water and leave open to air-dry.",,"Many people are diagnosed and treated for allergies by their primary care physicians.

A physical exam usually follows and these next steps may be needed:
Food diary.Your care team may ask you to keep a food diary of your eating habits, symptoms and medicines.
Skin test.A small amount of food or other substance is placed on your skin. Then, your skin is pricked with a needle. If you're allergic to that substance, you'll develop a raised bump or reaction.
Blood test.A blood test can measure your immune system's response to certain foods. It checks the amount of allergy-type antibodies in your bloodstream, also known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies.
Elimination diet.Your team may suggest an elimination diet if you could be allergic to more foods in addition to peanuts. You might be asked to stop eating peanuts or other suspect foods for a week or two. Then, you'll add the food items back into your diet one at a time. This process can help link symptoms to certain foods. If you've had a severe reaction to foods, this method can't safely be used.
All these sources may help confirm a peanut allergy. Or they may point to another cause such as food intolerance.","The standard approach to care for peanut allergy is to avoid foods that contain peanuts. Yet researchers continue to study different therapies that will lessen the chance of severe reactions, including anaphylaxis.","If your child has peanut allergy, take these steps to help keep your child safe:
Involve caregivers.Ask relatives, babysitters, teachers and other caregivers to help. Teach the adults who spend time with your child how to recognize signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction to peanuts. Emphasize that an allergic reaction can be life-threatening and requires immediate action.Also, make sure that your child knows to ask for help right away in case of an allergic reaction.
Use a written plan.Write down the steps to take in case of an allergic reaction. Include the order and doses of all medicines to be given. List contact information for family members and healthcare providers. Give a copy of the plan to family members, teachers and others who care for your child.
Discourage your child from sharing foods.It's common for kids to share snacks and treats. However, while playing, your child may forget about food allergies or sensitivities. If your child is allergic to peanuts, encourage your child not to eat food from others.
Make sure your child's epinephrine autoinjector is always available.An injection of epinephrine needs to be given right away to reduce the chance of anaphylaxis. Make sure caregivers and family members know about your child's emergency medicine. They should know where the autoinjector is located, when it may be needed and how to use it.
Make sure your child's school has a food allergy management plan.Guidelines are available to create policies and procedures. Staff should have access to an epinephrine injector and be trained how to use it.
Have your child wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace.This will help your child get the right treatment if communication isn't possible during a severe reaction. The alert will include your child's name and the type of food allergy. Also, it may list brief emergency instructions.
If you have peanut allergy,do the following:
Always carry your epinephrine autoinjector.
Wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace.","To get the most from your appointment, it's a good idea to be well prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment and know what to.
Describe your symptoms.Be ready to tell your doctor what happened after you ate peanuts or food that contains peanuts. Note how long it took for a reaction to occur. Try to recall how many peanuts you ate. Or how much you ate of a peanut-containing food that triggered your symptoms.
Make a list of all the medicines you're taking.Include vitamins or supplements.
Take a family member or friend along.Sometimes it can be difficult to recall all the information provided to you during an appointment. If someone can join you, that person may remember something that you missed or forgot.
Write down any questions you have.
Some basic questions to ask include:
Are my symptoms likely caused by peanut allergy?
What else might be causing my symptoms?
What tests do I need?
What's the best treatment?
Should I see a specialist?
Is there a generic version of the medicine you're prescribing?
Are there brochures or other printed material that I can take with me? What websites do you recommend?
Do I need to carry an epinephrine autoinjector?
If your child is seeing a healthcare professional for a peanut allergy, you also may want to ask:
Are there alternatives to the foods that trigger my child's allergy symptoms?
How can I help keep my child with peanut allergy safe at school?
Is my child likely to outgrow his or her allergy?

A history of allergic reactions shortly after exposure to shellfish can be a sign of shellfish allergy. But the symptoms could also be caused by something else, such as food poisoning.
Allergy testing is the only sure way to tell what's causing your symptoms, so your provider may recommend one or both of these tests:
Skin prick test.Small amounts of the proteins found in shellfish are pricked into skin on your arm or upper back. You're then watched for an allergic reaction. If you're allergic, you'll develop a raised bump (hive) at the test site on your skin. This typically takes about 15 to 20 minutes. Allergy specialists usually are best equipped to perform allergy skin tests.
Blood test.A blood sample is sent to a lab to measure your immune system's response to a specific allergen. This test measures your immune system's response to shellfish proteins by measuring the amount of allergy-causing antibodies in your bloodstream, known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies.
Medically supervised food challenges can be performed if the diagnosis still isn't clear after allergy testing.","The only sure way to prevent an allergic reaction to shellfish is to avoid shellfish. But despite your best efforts, you may come into contact with shellfish.
If you have a severe allergic reaction to shellfish (anaphylaxis), you'll likely need an emergency injection of epinephrine (adrenaline). If you're at risk of anaphylaxis to shellfish, your health care provider can give you a prescription in advance and explain how and when to give the injection. Regularly check the expiration date on the packaging to make sure it's current.
Carry injectable epinephrine (Auvi-Q, EpiPen, others) with you at all times. Epinephrine is typically given at the first sign of an allergic reaction. A second dose may be needed if symptoms recur. After you use epinephrine, seek emergency medical care, even if you start to feel better.",,You're likely to start by seeing your family health care provider.

Tests to rule out other conditions or help diagnoseALSmight include:
Electromyogram (EMG).A needle is inserted through the skin into various muscles. The test records the electrical activity of the muscles when they contract and when they're at rest. This can determine if there is a problem with the muscles or nerves.
Nerve conduction study.This study measures your nerves' ability to send impulses to muscles in different areas of the body. This test can determine if you have nerve damage.EMGand nerve conduction studies are almost always done together.
MRI.Using radio waves and a powerful magnetic field, anMRIproduces detailed images of the brain and spinal cord. AnMRIcan reveal spinal cord tumors, herniated disks in the neck or other conditions that might be causing your symptoms. The highest resolution cameras may sometimes seeALSchanges themselves.
Blood and urine tests.Analyzing samples of your blood and urine in the laboratory might help eliminate other possible causes of your symptoms. Serum neurofilament light levels, which are measured from blood samples, are generally high in people withALS. The test can help make a diagnosis early in the disease.
Spinal tap, known as a lumbar puncture.This involves removing a sample of spinal fluid for laboratory testing. Spinal fluid is removed using a small needle inserted between two bones in the lower back. The spinal fluid appears typical in people withALSbut may uncover another cause of symptoms.
Muscle biopsy.If your health care provider believes you may have a muscle disease rather thanALS, you might undergo a muscle biopsy. While you're under local anesthesia, a small piece of muscle is removed and sent to a lab for analysis.
Nerve biopsy.If your health care provider believes you may have a nerve disease rather thanALS, you might undergo a nerve biopsy. While you're under local anesthesia, a small piece of nerve is removed and sent to a lab for analysis.","Treatments can't reverse the damage ofALS, but they can slow the progression of symptoms.

Take time to grieve.The news that you have a fatal condition that reduces your mobility and independence is hard to hear. You and your family may go through a period of mourning and grief after diagnosis.
Be hopeful.Your team can help you focus on your abilities and healthy living. Some people withALSlive much longer than the 3 to 5 years usually associated with this condition. Some live 10 years or more. Maintaining an optimistic outlook can help improve quality of life for people withALS.
Think beyond the physical changes.Many people withALSlead rewarding lives despite physical limitations. Try to think ofALSas only one part of your life, not your entire identity.
Join a support group.You might find comfort in a support group with others who haveALS. Loved ones helping with your care might benefit from a support group of otherALScaregivers. Find support groups in your area by talking to your doctor or by contacting theALSAssociation.
Make decisions now about your future medical care.Planning for the future allows you to be in control of decisions about your life and your care. It also lessens the burden for your loved ones.

If your child's health care professional thinks your child might have thalassemia, blood tests can confirm it.

Blood tests can reveal the number of red blood cells and irregular changes in their size, shape or color. Blood tests also can be used to look for gene changes in DNA.","Mild forms of thalassemia trait don't need treatment.

For moderate to severe thalassemia, treatments might include:

Chelation therapy.This treatment removes extra iron from the blood. Iron can build up due to regular transfusions. Some people with thalassemia who don't have regular transfusions also can develop excess iron. Removing the excess iron is vital for your health.

To help rid your body of the extra iron, you might need to take medicine by mouth. The medicines include deferasirox (Exjade, Jadenu) or deferiprone (Ferriprox). Another drug called deferoxamine (Desferal) is given through a needle in a vein.

Other medicines.A medicine given by shot called luspatercept (Reblozyl) helps some people need fewer blood transfusions. A medicine taken by mouth called hydroxyurea (Hydrea, Droxia) can lower the chances of getting other health problems because of thalassemia.

Stem cell transplant.This also is called a bone marrow transplant. Sometimes, it might be a treatment option. For children with severe thalassemia, it can get rid of the need for lifelong blood transfusions and drugs to control iron overload.

A stem cell transplant involves receiving infusions of stem cells from a donor with matching cells, often a healthy sibling.","If you or your child has thalassemia, reach out for help when you need it. A member of your health care team can answer your questions or offer advice.

You also could think about joining a support group. This helps you meet other people affected by thalassemia. They can listen to your experiences, and they might be able to offer useful information. Ask a member of your health care team about groups in your area.","Most often, tests find moderate to severe forms of thalassemia within the first two years of life. If you've noticed some of the symptoms of thalassemia in your infant or child, see your child's pediatrician or the health care professional who cares for your family.

CT scan.This specialized X-ray is usually the first test used to assess for bleeding in the brain or another type of stroke. The test produces images that are 2D slices of the brain.A CT angiogram can create detailed images of the arteries providing blood flow in the brain. The test involves injecting dye into the vein that makes it easier to observe blood flow. It also can detect the presence of an aneurysm.
Lumbar puncture, known as a spinal tap.If you've had a subarachnoid hemorrhage, there will most likely be red blood cells in the fluid surrounding your brain and spine. This fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid. If you have symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm but a CT scan doesn't show evidence of bleeding, a test of your cerebrospinal fluid can help make a diagnosis.The procedure to draw cerebrospinal fluid from your back with a needle is called a lumbar puncture.
MRI.This imaging test uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain. These images may be either 2D or 3D images and can show if there's bleeding in the brain.A type of MRI that captures images of the arteries in detail is called MR angiography. This type of MRI can detect the size, shape and location of an aneurysm.
Cerebral angiogram.During this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is used. The catheter is inserted into an artery, usually in the groin or the wrist. The catheter threads past your heart to the arteries in your brain. A special dye injected into the catheter travels to arteries throughout your brain.A series of X-rays can then reveal details about the conditions of your arteries and detect an aneurysm. A cerebral angiogram — also called a cerebral arteriogram — is usually used when other diagnostic tests don't provide enough information.","Repairing a ruptured aneurysm requires surgery or endovascular treatment. Endovascular treatment means an aneurysm is treated from inside the artery. You also may be given treatments to relieve symptoms.
If you have an unruptured aneurysm, talk with your healthcare professional about possible treatments. Talk about whether the risk of leaving the aneurysm alone is greater than the risk of treating the aneurysm.
Factors that your healthcare team considers before making treatment recommendations include:
The aneurysm size, location and overall appearance of the aneurysm.

You may have one or more tests and procedures. These can either diagnose vasculitis or rule out other conditions that cause some of the same symptoms. Tests and procedures might include:
Blood tests.These tests look for signs of inflammation, such as a high level of C-reactive protein. A complete blood cell count can tell whether you have enough red blood cells. Other blood tests, such as the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) test, can look for certain antibodies. These tests can help diagnose vasculitis.
Imaging tests.Imaging tests can show which blood vessels and organs are affected. They also can help your healthcare professional know how you respond to treatment. Imaging tests for vasculitis include X-rays, ultrasounds, CT scans, MRIs and positron emission tomography (PET) scans.
X-rays of your blood vessels.During this procedure, called angiography, a flexible catheter resembling a thin straw goes into a large artery or vein. A special dye goes into the catheter. You have X-rays taken as the dye fills the artery or vein. The X-rays show the outlines of your blood vessels.
Biopsy.This is a surgery in which a healthcare professional removes a small sample of tissue from the affected area of your body. Your health professional then looks at the tissue for signs of vasculitis.","Treatment aims to control the swelling and irritation, called inflammation.

A pelvic exam.You may be examined while lying down and possibly while standing up. During the exam, your provider looks for a tissue bulge into your vagina that indicates pelvic organ prolapse. You'll likely be asked to bear down as if during a bowel movement to see how much that affects the degree of prolapse. To check the strength of your pelvic floor muscles, you'll be asked to contract them, as if you're trying to stop the stream of urine.
Filling out a questionnaire.You may fill out a form that helps your provider assess your medical history, the degree of your prolapse and how much it affects your quality of life. This information also helps guide treatment decisions.
Bladder and urine tests.If you have significant prolapse, you might be tested to see how well and completely your bladder empties. Your provider might also run a test on a urine sample to look for signs of a bladder infection, if it seems that you're retaining more urine in your bladder than is normal after urinating.","Treatment depends on whether you have symptoms, how severe your anterior prolapse is and whether you have any related conditions, such as urinary incontinence or more than one type of pelvic organ prolapse.
Mild cases — those with few or no obvious symptoms — typically don't require treatment. Your provider may recommend a wait-and-see approach, with occasional visits to monitor your prolapse.
If you do have symptoms of anterior prolapse, first line treatment options include:
Pelvic floor muscle exercises.These exercises — often called Kegel exercises or Kegels — help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles, so they can better support your bladder and other pelvic organs. Your provider or a physical therapist can give you instructions for how to do these exercises and can help you determine whether you're doing them correctly.
A supportive device (pessary).A vaginal pessary is a plastic or rubber ring inserted into your vagina to support the bladder. A pessary does not fix or cure the actual prolapse, but the extra support the device provides can help relieve symptoms.

This allows typical bacteria to grow back, restoring the healthy balance of bacteria in your colon.

You may be given antibiotics by mouth, through a vein or through a tube inserted through the nose into the stomach, called a nasogastric tube. Vancomycin or fidaxomicin (Dificid) is most often used, but the choice depends on your condition. If these medicines are not available or you cannot tolerate them, then metronidazole (Flagyl) may be used.

For severe disease, your provider may prescribe vancomycin by mouth combined with intravenous metronidazole or a vancomycin enema.

Once you begin treatment for pseudomembranous colitis, symptoms may begin to improve within a few days.",,"Your primary health care provider can usually treat pseudomembranous colitis.

Several specialists on your health care team might help diagnose you or your child with auditory processing disorder (APD). For children, the team might include teachers, who look at learning and attention issues. For children and adults, the team might include mental health professionals, called psychologists, who look at how the mind works. And speech-language pathologists can look at the use of language.
A hearing specialist called an audiologist may do tests to see what is happening when you or your child hear sounds. These tests might include:
Tympanometry.This test can tell if the eardrum isn't moving well. The eardrum needs to move for good hearing. For this test, the audiologist places a soft probe in the ear canal. Then they send small bits of air pressure toward the ear. The probe measures how much the eardrum moves in response to the air.
Acoustic reflex test.This test shows what happens in the ear when it hears a loud sound.
Auditory brainstem response.This test shows how well the inner ear, called the cochlea, and the brain pathways for hearing are working. An audiologist places sensors around the ear and on the head. The sensors connect to a computer.Short clicking sounds come through headphones worn during the test. The computer records how the nerves between the ears and the brain respond to the sounds.
Evoked potential test.This test shows how well sound travels along the nerves that connect the ears to the brain. For this test, an audiologist places sensors on the head. The sensors connect to a computer. Short clicking sounds come through headphones worn during the test.This lets an audiologist see how well sound gets to different parts of the brain. It also shows if anything is blocking the nerves that link the ears to the brain.","Not everyone with auditory processing disorder (APD) needs treatment. If you or your child need treatment, there are many approaches. Every person withAPDhas different needs. Your health care team can work with you to help you. Your or your child's treatment might include:
Hearing aids and listening devices.Your health care team may suggest that you use hearing aids with wireless listening devices. Listening devices help direct sound to you. They get sound from the source to your hearing aid.Frequency modulated, or FM, systems send sounds to you so you can hear them better. They work with a hearing aid and direct sounds to it. These systems help make it easier to hear sounds in noisy environments.
Auditory training.Auditory training,also called hearing rehabilitation, helps you adjust to hearing loss. You may train with an audiologist, a speech-language pathologist or both. You may train one-on-one with a therapist or as part of a group.During auditory training, you learn to tell one type of sound from another. You do this by listening to sounds that are louder and softer, given quickly and slowly. Sounds come from different directions. You also learn to tell the difference between speech sounds, which affects the meaning of the words you hear.Auditory training helps the brain tell the difference between the many sounds you hear every day. The goal is to help you feel like you're able to talk with others more.
Computer-based training.Computer-based programs can help train the brain to recognize and understand sounds. These programs are like auditory training, but you do them online or with a computer program.","Having auditory processing disorder (APD) can make you feel left out of everyday events. It can make you feel lonely. Auditory training as part of your treatment may help you or your child learn how to cope with hearing loss and adjust to it.
Auditory training might help you or your child learn to talk to others better and help them talk to you. This can help you feel less alone and more connected to others.","You or your child might start by seeing your family health care professional.

Have the person with the condition carry an identification card and other materials that can help explain the condition to others.
Give the person time to talk.
Speak slowly in simple, adult sentences and listen carefully.
Talk with the person with the condition about how you can help.
Take care of your personal needs. Get enough rest and make time for social activities.
Family members eventually may need to make long-term care choices for the person with primary progressive aphasia. They also may need to plan the person's finances and help make legal decisions to prepare for more-serious stages of the condition. Start this process early so the person with primary progressive aphasia can be involved.

To diagnose broken heart syndrome, a healthcare professional examines you and asks questions about your symptoms and medical history. You may be asked if you've had any major stresses recently, such as the death of a loved one.
People who have broken heart syndrome usually don't have any heart disease symptoms before the condition is diagnosed.
Tests to help diagnose broken heart syndrome include:
Blood tests.People who have broken heart syndrome often have higher levels of substances called cardiac enzymes in the blood.
Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG).This quick test measures the electrical activity of the heart. Sticky patches called electrodes are placed on the chest and sometimes the arms and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a computer, which shows the test results.AnECGshows how fast or how slow the heart is beating.ECGresults for broken heart syndrome look different from those for a heart attack.
Coronary angiogram.This test checks for blockages in the heart arteries. It's done to rule out a heart attack. People with broken heart syndrome often don't have any blockages. A doctor inserts a long, thin flexible tube called a catheter into a blood vessel, usually in the groin or wrist. It's guided to the heart. Dye flows through the catheter to arteries in the heart. The dye helps the arteries show up more clearly on X-ray images and video.Once it's clear that you're not having a heart attack, your doctor checks to see if your symptoms are caused by broken heart syndrome.
Echocardiogram.This test uses sound waves to create pictures of the beating heart. It shows how blood flows through the heart and heart valves. It can see if the heart is enlarged or has an unusual shape. These changes may be due to broken heart syndrome.
CardiacMRI.This test uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the heart.","There's no standard treatment for broken heart syndrome. Treatment is similar to heart attack care until the diagnosis is clear. Most people stay in the hospital while they get better.
Many people with broken heart syndrome are fully recovered within a month or so. An echocardiogram is done about 4 to 6 weeks after the first symptoms to make sure the heart is working better. Sometimes, broken heart syndrome happens again after treatment.",,"Broken heart syndrome is usually diagnosed in an emergency or a hospital setting.
If possible, have a family member or friend come with you to the hospital. Someone who goes with you can help you remember the information you're given.
If possible, share important information with the person taking you to the hospital:
Any symptoms you're having,and how long you've had them.
Your important personal information,including any major stresses, such as the death of a loved one, or recent life changes, such as the loss of a job.
Your personal and family medical history,including health conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol or heart disease.
A list of the medicinesyou take, including those bought without a prescription.
Any recent injury to your chestthat may have caused damage inside the body, such as a broken rib or pinched nerve.
At the hospital, you may have many questions. If possible, you may want to ask:
What do you think is causing my symptoms?
I recently experienced the sudden death of a loved one. Could my symptoms be due to this event?
What kinds of tests do I need?
Do I need to stay in the hospital?
What treatments do I need right now?

To confirm a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome, the antibodies must appear in your blood at least twice, in tests conducted 12 or more weeks apart.

You can have antiphospholipid antibodies and never develop signs or symptoms. A diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome is made only when these antibodies cause health problems.","If you have blood clots, standard initial treatment involves a combination of blood-thinning medications. The most common are heparin and warfarin (Jantoven). Heparin is fast-acting and delivered via injections. Warfarin comes in pill form and takes several days to take effect. Aspirin is also a blood thinner.

When you're taking blood thinners, you have an increased risk of bleeding episodes. Your doctor will monitor your dosage with blood tests to be sure your blood is capable of clotting enough to stop the bleeding of a cut or the bleeding under the skin from a bruise.

There is some evidence that other drugs might be helpful in treating antiphospholipid syndrome. These include hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), rituximab (Rituxan) and statins. More study is needed.",,"In most cases, complications of antiphospholipid syndrome — such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stroke or pregnancy loss — will prompt you to seek medical care.

Comminuted fracture.The bone is broken into pieces, so it might require surgery.
Greenstick fracture.The bone cracks but doesn't break all the way — like what happens when you bend a green stick of wood. Most broken bones in children are greenstick fractures because children's bones are softer and more flexible than are those of adults.
Buckle (torus) fracture.One side of the bone is compressed, which causes the other side to bend (buckle).

Giant cell arteritis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/giant-cell-arteritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20372758,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/giant-cell-arteritis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20372764,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/giant-cell-arteritis/doctors-departments/ddc-20372765,"Giant cell arteritis can be difficult to diagnose because its early symptoms resemble those of other common conditions. For this reason, your doctor will try to rule out other possible causes of your problem.
In addition to asking about your symptoms and medical history, your doctor is likely to perform a thorough physical exam, paying particular attention to your temporal arteries. Often, one or both of these arteries are tender, with a reduced pulse and a hard, cordlike feel and appearance.
Your doctor might also recommend certain tests.","The main treatment for giant cell arteritis consists of high doses of a corticosteroid drug such as prednisone. Because immediate treatment is necessary to prevent vision loss, your doctor is likely to start medication even before confirming the diagnosis with a biopsy.
You'll likely begin to feel better within a few days of beginning treatment. If you have visual loss before starting treatment with corticosteroids, it's unlikely that your vision will improve. However, your unaffected eye might be able to compensate for some of the visual changes.
You may need to continue taking medication for one to two years or longer. After the first month, your doctor might gradually begin to lower the dosage until you reach the lowest dose of corticosteroids needed to control inflammation.
Some symptoms, particularly headaches, may return during this tapering period. This is the point at which many people also develop symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica. Such flares can usually be treated with slight increases in the corticosteroid dose. Your doctor might also suggest an immune-suppressing drug called methotrexate (Trexall).
Corticosteroids can lead to serious side effects, such as osteoporosis, high blood pressure and muscle weakness. To counter potential side effects, your doctor is likely to monitor your bone density and might prescribe calcium and vitamin D supplements or other medications to help prevent bone loss.
The Food and Drug Administration recently approved tocilizumab (Actemra) to treat giant cell arteritis. It's given as an injection under your skin. Side effects include making you more prone to infections. More research is needed.","Learning everything you can about giant cell arteritis and its treatment can help you feel more in control of your condition. Your health care team can answer your questions, and online support groups might also be of help. Know the possible side effects of the medications you take, and report any changes in your health to your doctor.","You might start by seeing your primary care doctor.

He or she may also have you undergo some of the following tests and procedures to help rule out other conditions that resemble Takayasu's arteritis and to confirm the diagnosis. Some of these tests may also be used to check on your progress during treatment.

X-rays of your blood vessels (angiography).During an angiogram, a long, flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into a large artery or vein. A special contrast dye is then injected into the catheter, and X-rays are taken as the dye fills your arteries or veins.

The resulting images allow your doctor to see if blood is flowing normally or if it's being slowed or interrupted due to narrowing (stenosis) of a blood vessel. A person with Takayasu's arteritis generally has several areas of stenosis.","Treatment of Takayasu's arteritis focuses on controlling inflammation with medications and preventing further damage to your blood vessels.

Takayasu's arteritis can be difficult to treat because the disease may remain active even if your symptoms improve. It's also possible that irreversible damage has already occurred by the time you're diagnosed.

On the other hand, if you don't have signs and symptoms or serious complications, you may not need treatment or you may be able to taper and stop treatment if your doctor recommends it.","One of the greatest challenges of living with Takayasu's arteritis may be coping with side effects of your medication. The following suggestions may help:

Eat a healthy diet.Eating well can help prevent potential problems that can result from your condition and medications, such as high blood pressure, thinning bones and diabetes. Emphasize fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats and fish, while limiting salt, sugar and alcohol.

If you're taking a corticosteroid drug, ask your doctor if you need to take a vitamin D or calcium supplement.","If your primary care doctor suspects that you have Takayasu's arteritis, he or she may refer you to one or more specialists with experience in helping people with this condition.

If your child shows any symptoms of autism, you'll likely be referred to a specialist who treats children with autism spectrum disorder for an evaluation. This specialist could be a child psychiatrist or psychologist, a pediatric neurologist, or a developmental pediatrician.
Because autism spectrum disorder symptoms and how severe they are can vary widely, it may be hard to make a diagnosis. There is no specific medical test to diagnose autism spectrum disorder. Instead, a specialist may:
Observe your child and ask how your child has developed or changed over time in terms of interacting socially, communicating and behaving.
Give your child tests covering hearing, speech, language, level of development, and social and behavioral issues.
Present structured social and communication interactions to your child and score the performance.
Include other specialists in coming up with a diagnosis.
Recommend genetic testing to figure out whether your child has a genetic condition such as Rett syndrome or fragile X syndrome.","There is no cure for autism spectrum disorder, and there is no one-size-fits-all treatment. Treatment seeks to support your child's learning, development and behavior. Getting treated early, during the preschool years, can help your child learn critical social, communication, functional and behavioral skills.
The range of home-based and school-based treatments for autism spectrum disorder can be overwhelming, and your child's needs may change over time. Your healthcare professional can recommend options and help find resources in your area.
If your child is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, talk with experts about creating a treatment strategy and build a team of health professionals to meet your child's needs.
Treatment options may include:
Behavior and communication therapies.Many programs address the range of social, language and behavioral difficulties linked with autism spectrum disorder. Some programs focus on reducing challenging behaviors and teaching new skills. Other programs focus on teaching children how to act in social situations or communicate better with others. Applied behavior analysis can help children learn new skills and adapt these skills to many situations by motivating them with rewards.
Educational therapies.Children with autism spectrum disorder often respond well to highly structured educational programs. Successful programs usually include a team of specialists and various activities to improve social skills, communication and behavior. Preschool children who get intensive, individualized behavioral treatments often show good progress.
Family therapies.Parents and other family members can learn how to play and interact with children who have autism in ways that support social interaction skills, manage challenging behaviors, and teach daily living skills and communication.
Other therapies.Depending on your child's needs, speech therapy to make communication skills better, occupational therapy to teach activities of daily living, and physical therapy to make movement and balance better may help. A psychologist can recommend ways to manage problem behavior.
Medicines.Medicine can't make the core signs of autism spectrum disorder better, but specific medicines can help control symptoms. For example, certain medicines may be prescribed if your child is hyperactive. Sometimes healthcare professionals prescribe antipsychotic medicines to treat severe behavioral symptoms. Or they may prescribe antidepressants for anxiety. Keep all healthcare professionals updated on any medicines or supplements your child takes. Some medicines and supplements can affect how one medicine acts with another, causing dangerous side effects.","Raising a child with autism spectrum disorder can tire you physically and drain you emotionally. These suggestions may help:
Find a team of trusted health professionals and others.A team, coordinated by your healthcare professional, may include social workers, teachers, therapists, and a case manager or service coordinator. Team members can help find and assess the resources in your area. They also can explain financial services and state and federal programs for children and adults with disabilities.
Keep records of visits with healthcare professionals.Your child may have visits, evaluations and meetings with many people on the care team. Keep an organized file of these meetings and reports to help you decide about treatment options and watch progress.
Learn about the disorder.There are many stories and beliefs that are not true about autism spectrum disorder. Learning the truth can help you better understand your child and attempts to communicate.
Take time for yourself and other family members.Caring for a child with autism spectrum disorder can put stress on your personal relationships and your family. To avoid burnout, take time out to relax, exercise or enjoy your favorite activities. Try to schedule one-on-one time with your other children and plan date nights with your spouse or partner — even if it's just watching a movie together after the children go to bed.
Seek out other families of children with autism spectrum disorder.Other families managing the challenges of autism spectrum disorder may have useful advice. Some communities have support groups for parents and siblings of children with the disorder.
Ask your healthcare professional about new technologies and therapies.Researchers continue to explore new ways to help children with autism spectrum disorder. See the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website on autism spectrum disorder for helpful materials and links to resources.","Your child's healthcare professional looks for developmental issues at regular checkups.

Your child's health care provider considers the symptoms and their frequency and your child's medical history. Your child might need tests to rule out other conditions and to identify the most likely cause of the symptoms.

A number of childhood conditions can have symptoms similar to those caused by asthma. To complicate the diagnosis further, these conditions also commonly occur with asthma. So your child's provider will have to determine whether your child's symptoms are caused by asthma, a condition other than asthma, or both asthma and another condition.

Conditions that can cause asthma-like symptoms include:

Your child may need the following tests:

Lung function tests, also called spirometry.Health care providers diagnose asthma in children with the same tests used to identify the disease in adults. Spirometry measures how much air your child can exhale and how quickly. Your child might have lung function tests at rest, after exercising and after taking asthma medicine.

Another lung function test is brochoprovocation. Using spirometry, this test measures how the lungs react to certain provocations, such as exercise or exposure to cold air.

These asthma tests aren't accurate before 5 years of age, however. For younger children, your provider will rely on information you and your child provide about symptoms. Sometimes a diagnosis can't be made until later, after months or even years of observing symptoms.","Initial treatment depends on the severity of your child's asthma. The goal of asthma treatment is to keep symptoms under control, meaning that your child has:

Treating asthma involves both preventing symptoms and treating an asthma attack in progress. The right medicine for your child depends on a few things, including:

For children younger than age 3 who have mild symptoms of asthma, your provider might use a wait-and-see approach. This is because the long-term effects of asthma medicine in infants and young children aren't clear.

However, if an infant or toddler has frequent or severe wheezing episodes, a health care provider might prescribe a medicine to see if it improves symptoms.","It can be stressful to help your child manage asthma. Keep these tips in mind to make life as easy as possible:

Use a written asthma action plan.Work with your child's health care provider to develop your child's action plan, and give a copy to all of your child's caregivers, such as child care providers, teachers, coaches and the parents of your child's friends.

Following a written plan can help you and your child identify symptoms early, providing important information on how to treat your child's asthma from day to day and how to deal with an asthma attack.

Be encouraging.Focus attention on what your child can do, not on limitations. Involve teachers, school nurses, coaches, relatives and friends in helping your child manage asthma.

Encourage typical play and activity. Don't limit your child's activities out of fear of an asthma attack — work with your child's provider to control exercise-induced symptoms.","You're likely to start by taking your child to your primary health care provider or your child's pediatrician.

A member of your healthcare team takes your blood pressure. You are usually asked questions about your symptoms, health habits and medical history.","Treatment of atrial tachycardia depends on what causes it and how severe it is. Treatment may include:
Vagal maneuvers.Simple but specific actions such as coughing, putting an ice pack on the face or pushing down as if having a bowel movement can help slow down the heart rate. These actions affect the vagus nerve, which helps control the heartbeat.
Medicines.Medicines may be given to control the heart rate and reset the heart rhythm. Some medicines may need to be given byIV.
Cardioversion.Paddles or patches on the chest are used to give an electrical shock to the heart. The quick, low-energy shock resets the heart's rhythm. This may be a treatment option if atrial tachycardia doesn't get better with vagal maneuvers or medicine.
Catheter ablation.A doctor guides a thin, flexible tube called a catheter through a blood vessel, usually in the groin, and up to the heart. Sometimes more than one catheter is used. Sensors on the tip of the catheter use heat energy, called radiofrequency energy, to create tiny scars in the heart. The scar tissue blocks faulty electrical signals. This restores a regular heartbeat.
Pacemaker.A pacemaker is a small device that's placed in the chest to help control the heartbeat. When it finds an irregular heartbeat, it sends an electrical signal that helps correct the heart's rhythm. A pacemaker may be needed if other treatments for atrial tachycardia don't work. For people with atrial tachycardia, a pacemaker is typically placed during with a treatment calledAVnode ablation.",,"If you have a very fast heartbeat, call your healthcare professional.

After birth, symptoms of complete atrioventricular canal defect are usually noticeable within the first weeks. When listening to a baby's heart, a health care provider might hear a whooshing sound. The sound is called a heart murmur.

Tests to diagnose atrioventricular canal defect may include:","Surgery is needed to treat a complete or partial atrioventricular canal defect. More than one surgery may be needed. Surgery involves using one or two patches to close the hole in the heart wall. The patches stay in the heart. They become part of the heart's wall as the heart's lining grows over them.

Other surgeries depend on whether the defect is partial or complete and what other heart problems exist.

For a partial atrioventricular canal defect, surgery to repair the mitral valve is needed so that the valve will close tightly. If repair isn't possible, the valve might need to be replaced.

For a complete atrioventricular canal defect, surgeons separate the large single valve between the upper and lower heart chambers into two valves. If this isn't possible, the mitral and tricuspid valves might need to be replaced.

Many people who have corrective surgery for atrioventricular canal defect don't need more surgery. However, some complications, such as heart valve leaks, may require treatment.","Many children with heart problems present at birth grow up to lead healthy lives.

Diagnosis isn't usually made before 9 months of age. Signs and symptoms typically appear before the age of 5 years.

DSM-5 criteria for diagnosis include:","Children with reactive attachment disorder are believed to have the capacity to form attachments, but this ability has been hindered by their early developmental experiences.

Most children are naturally resilient. And even those who've been neglected, lived in a children's home or other institution, or had multiple caregivers can develop healthy relationships. Early intervention appears to improve outcomes.

There's no standard treatment for reactive attachment disorder, but it should involve both the child and parents or primary caregivers. Goals of treatment are to help ensure that the child:

Several specialists on your health care team might help diagnose you or your child with auditory processing disorder (APD). For children, the team might include teachers, who look at learning and attention issues. For children and adults, the team might include mental health professionals, called psychologists, who look at how the mind works. And speech-language pathologists can look at the use of language.
A hearing specialist called an audiologist may do tests to see what is happening when you or your child hear sounds. These tests might include:
Tympanometry.This test can tell if the eardrum isn't moving well. The eardrum needs to move for good hearing. For this test, the audiologist places a soft probe in the ear canal. Then they send small bits of air pressure toward the ear. The probe measures how much the eardrum moves in response to the air.
Acoustic reflex test.This test shows what happens in the ear when it hears a loud sound.
Auditory brainstem response.This test shows how well the inner ear, called the cochlea, and the brain pathways for hearing are working. An audiologist places sensors around the ear and on the head. The sensors connect to a computer.Short clicking sounds come through headphones worn during the test. The computer records how the nerves between the ears and the brain respond to the sounds.
Evoked potential test.This test shows how well sound travels along the nerves that connect the ears to the brain. For this test, an audiologist places sensors on the head. The sensors connect to a computer. Short clicking sounds come through headphones worn during the test.This lets an audiologist see how well sound gets to different parts of the brain. It also shows if anything is blocking the nerves that link the ears to the brain.","Not everyone with auditory processing disorder (APD) needs treatment. If you or your child need treatment, there are many approaches. Every person withAPDhas different needs. Your health care team can work with you to help you. Your or your child's treatment might include:
Hearing aids and listening devices.Your health care team may suggest that you use hearing aids with wireless listening devices. Listening devices help direct sound to you. They get sound from the source to your hearing aid.Frequency modulated, or FM, systems send sounds to you so you can hear them better. They work with a hearing aid and direct sounds to it. These systems help make it easier to hear sounds in noisy environments.
Auditory training.Auditory training,also called hearing rehabilitation, helps you adjust to hearing loss. You may train with an audiologist, a speech-language pathologist or both. You may train one-on-one with a therapist or as part of a group.During auditory training, you learn to tell one type of sound from another. You do this by listening to sounds that are louder and softer, given quickly and slowly. Sounds come from different directions. You also learn to tell the difference between speech sounds, which affects the meaning of the words you hear.Auditory training helps the brain tell the difference between the many sounds you hear every day. The goal is to help you feel like you're able to talk with others more.
Computer-based training.Computer-based programs can help train the brain to recognize and understand sounds. These programs are like auditory training, but you do them online or with a computer program.","Having auditory processing disorder (APD) can make you feel left out of everyday events. It can make you feel lonely. Auditory training as part of your treatment may help you or your child learn how to cope with hearing loss and adjust to it.
Auditory training might help you or your child learn to talk to others better and help them talk to you. This can help you feel less alone and more connected to others.","You or your child might start by seeing your family health care professional.
